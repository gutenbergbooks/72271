TRANSLATOR’S NOTE.</h3>

<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> spelling of Russian names is a matter of
peculiar difficulty, and no fixed usage in regard to
it has as yet been established. I have tried to
follow the system presented in the Proceedings of
the American Library Association for 1885, but
it has been in some cases impossible for me to
go back to the original Russian form as a starting-point.
I have found it necessary to abridge
M. de Vogüé’s work somewhat, in order to bring
it within certain prescribed limits.</p>

<span class="ls">PREFACE</span>.
</h3>
</div>

<hr class="short">

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> offering this book to the constantly increasing
class of persons interested in Russian literature,
I owe them a little explanation in regard to
the unavoidable omissions in these essays, as well
as to their object and aim. The region we are
approaching is a vast, almost unexplored one; we
can only venture upon some of its highways,
selecting certain provinces, while we neglect
others.</p>

<p>This volume does not claim to give a complete
history of Russian literature, or a didactic treatise
upon it. Such a work does not yet exist in
Russia, and would be premature even in France.</p>

<p>My aim is quite a different one. To do justice
to both the dead and the living, in a history of the
literature of only the past hundred years, I
should but accumulate a quantity of names
foreign to our ears, and a list of works which
have never been translated. The entire political
and social history of the three preceding reigns
should be written, to properly explain the last.</p>

<p>It appears to me better to proceed as a naturalist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
would do in his researches in a foreign
country. He would collect specimens peculiarly
characteristic of the climate and soil, and choose
from among them a few individual types which
are perfectly developed. He draws our attention
to them, as best revealing to us the actual and
peculiar conditions of life in this particular corner
of the earth.</p>

<p>This is my plan. I shall briefly touch upon the
earliest Russian literature, and show how it became
subjected to foreign influences, from which
it was finally emancipated in the present century.</p>

<p>From this time, I am embarrassed in choosing
from such a rich supply of material, but I shall
confine myself to a few individual types. This
method is, besides, even more legitimate in Russia
than in more recently settled countries. If you
go through one hundred different villages between
St. Petersburg and Moscow, you will see that, in
feature, bearing, and costume the people seem to
be remarkably similar; so that a few portraits,
chosen at random, will describe the whole race,
both as to physical and moral traits.</p>

<p>This series of studies is principally devoted to
the four distinguished contemporary writers,
already well known in Europe by their translated
works. I have tried to show the man as well as
his work; and both, as illustrating the Russian
national character. Without paying much attention
to the rules of literary composition, I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
been glad to make use of everything which would
help me to carry out my design: of biographical
details, personal recollections, digressions upon
points of historical and political interest, without
which the moral evolutions of a country so little
known would be quite unintelligible. There is
but one rule to be followed; to use every means
of illuminating the object you wish to exhibit,
that it may be thoroughly understood in all its
phases. To this end, I have used the method of
comparison between the Russian authors and those
of other countries more familiar to us, as the
surest and most rapid one.</p>

<p>Some persons may express surprise that it
is of her novelists that I demand the secret of
Russia.</p>

<p>It is because poetry and romance, the modes
of expression most natural to this people, are
alone compatible with the exigencies of a press-censure
which was formerly most severe, and is
even now very suspicious. There is no medium
for ideas save through the supple meshes of fiction;
so that the fiction which shields yet conveys
these ideas assumes the importance of a doctrinal
treatise.</p>

<p>Of these two leading forms of literature, the
first, poetry, absorbed the early part of the present
century; the other, the novel, has superseded
poetry, and monopolized the attention of the
whole nation for the last forty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
With the great name of Pushkin at the head of
the list, the Russians consider the romantic period
as the crowning point of their intellectual glory.
I once agreed with them, but have had two motives
for changing my opinion.</p>

<p>In the first place, it would be quite useless to
discuss works which we could not quote from;
for the Russian poets have never been and never
will be translated. The life and beauty of a lyric
poem is in its arrangement of words and its
rhythm; this beauty cannot be transferred into a
foreign form. I once read a very admirable and
exact Russian translation of Alfred de Musset’s
“<cite>Nights</cite>”; it produced the same sensation as
when we look upon a beautiful corpse; the soul
had fled, like the divine essence which was the
life of those charming verses.</p>

<p>The task is yet more difficult when you attempt
to transfer an idea from the most poetical language
in Europe into one which possesses the
least of that quality. Certain verses of Pushkin
and Lermontof are the finest I know in any
language. But in the fragment of French prose
they are transferred into, you glean but a commonplace
thought. Many have tried, and many
more will continue to try to translate them,
but the result is not worth the effort. Besides,
it does not seem to me that this romantic
poetry expresses what is most typical of the
Russian spirit. By giving poetry the first rank
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
in their literature, their critics are influenced
by the <em>prestige</em> of the past and the enthusiasm
of youth; for the passage of time adds
lustre to what is past, to the detriment of the
present.</p>

<p>A foreigner can perhaps judge more truly in
this case; for distance equalizes all remote objects
on the same plane. I believe that the great novelists
of the past forty years will be of more service
to Russia than her poets. For the first time
she is in advance of Western Europe through her
writers, who have expressed æsthetic forms of
thought which are peculiarly her own. This is
why I choose these romances as illustrative of the
national character. Ten years’ study of these
works has suggested to me many thoughts relative
to the character of this people, and the part
it is destined to fill in the domain of intellect.
As the novelist undertakes to bring up every
problem of the national life, it will not be a
matter of surprise if I make use of works of fiction
in touching upon grave subjects and in the
weaving together of some abstract thoughts.</p>

<p>We shall see the Russians plead the cause of
realism with new arguments, and better ones, in
my opinion, than those of their rivals in the West.</p>

<p>This work is an important one, and is the foundation
of all the contests of ideas in the civilized
world; revealing, moreover, the most characteristic
conceptions of our contemporaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
In all primitive literature, the classical hero
was the only one considered worthy of attention,
representing in action all ideas on religions, monarchical,
social, and moral subjects, existing from
time immemorial. In exaggerating the qualities
of his hero, either for good or evil, the classic
poet took for his model what he deemed should
or should not be expected of him, rather than
what such a character would be in reality.</p>

<p>For the last century, other views have gradually
prevailed. Observation, rather than imagination,
has been employed. The writer constantly
gives us a close analysis of actions and feelings,
rather than the diversion and excitement of
intrigues and the display of passions. Classic
art was like a king who has the right to govern,
punish, reward, and choose his favorites from
an aristocracy, obliging them to adopt conventional
rules as to manners, morals, and modes of
speech. The new art tries to imitate nature in its
unconsciousness, its moral indifference. It expresses
the triumph of the masses over the individual,
of the crowd over the solitary hero, of the
relative over the absolute. It has been called
natural, realistic; would the word democratic
suffice to define it, or not? It would be short-sighted
in us not to perceive that political
changes are only episodes in the great and universal
change which is taking place.</p>

<p>Man has undertaken to explain the Universe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
and perceives that the existence itself, the greatness
and the dangers of this Universe are the
result of the incessant accumulation of infinitesimal
atoms. While institutions put the ruling of
states into the hands of the multitude, science
gave up the Universe to the control of the atoms
of which it is composed. In the analysis of all
physical and moral phenomena, the ancient theories
as to their origin are entirely displaced by the
doctrine of the constant evolution of microscopic
and invisible beings. The moral sciences feel the
shock communicated by the discoveries in natural
science. The psychologist, who studies the secrets
of the soul, finds that the human being is the
result of a long series of accumulated sensations
and actions, always influenced by its surroundings,
as the sensitive strings of an instrument
vary according to the surrounding temperature.</p>

<p>Are not these tendencies affecting practical life
as well, in the doctrines of equality of classes,
division of property, universal suffrage, and all
the other consequences of this principle, which
are summed up in the word democracy, the
watchword of our times? Sixty years ago, the
tide of the stream of democracy ran high, but now
the stream has become an ocean, which is seeking
its level over the entire surface of Europe. Here
and there, little islets remain, solid rocks upon
which thrones still stand, occasional fragments of
feudal governments, with a clinging remnant of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
caste privileges; but the most far-seeing of these
monarchs and of these castes know well that
the sea is rising. Their only hope is that a democratic
organization may not be incompatible with
a monarchical form; we shall find in Russia a
patriarchal democracy growing up within the
shadow of an absolute power.</p>

<p>Literature, which always expresses the existing
condition of society, could not escape this general
change of base; at first instinctively, then as a
doctrine, it regulated its methods and its ideals
according to the new spirit. Its first efforts at
reformation were awkward and uncertain; romanticism,
as we know to-day, was but a bastard production.
It was merely a reaction against the
classic hero, but was still unconsciously permeated
by the classic spirit. Men soon tired of this, and
demanded of authors more sincerity, and representations
of the world more conformable to the
teachings of the positive sciences, which were
gaining ground day by day. They demanded to
know more of human life, of ideas, and the relations
of human beings to each other. Then it
was that realism sprung into existence, and was
adopted by all European literature, and is still
reigning, with the various shades of difference
that we shall allude to. A path was prepared
for it by the universal revolution I have spoken
of; but a realization of the general causes of this
revolution could alone give to literature a philosophical
turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
These great changes in men’s ideas were
thought to be due to the advancement in scientific
knowledge, and the resulting freedom of thought,
which for a time inaugurated the worship of reason.
But beyond the circle of truth already conquered
appeared new and unknown abysses, and
man found himself still a slave, oppressed by
natural laws, in bondage to his passions. Then
his presumption vanished. He fell back into
uncertainty and doubt. Better armed and wiser,
undoubtedly, but his necessities increased with
the means of satisfying them. Disenchanted, his
old instincts came back to him; he sought a
higher Power,—but could find none. Everything
conspired to break up the traditions of
the past; the pride of reason, fully persuaded
of its own power, as well as the aggravating
stubbornness of orthodoxy. By a strange contradiction,
the pride of intelligence increased
with universal doubt which shattered all opinions.</p>

<p>All the Sages having declared that the new
theories regarding the universe were contrary to
religious explanations, pride refused to make further
researches. The defenders of orthodoxy have
done little to facilitate matters. They did not
understand that their doctrine was the fountain-head
of all progress, and that they turned that
stream from its natural direction by opposing the
discoveries of science and all political changes.</p>

<p>The strongest proof of the truth of a doctrine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
is the faculty of accommodating itself to all
human developments, without changing itself, because
it contains the germ of all the developments.
The remarkable power of religion over
men arises from this faculty; when orthodoxy
does not recognize this gift, it depreciates its
own strength.</p>

<p>By reason of this misunderstanding, the responsibility
of which should be shared by all parties,
it has taken a long time to come to a perception
of this simple truth. The world has been for
eighteen centuries in a state of fermentation,
through the gospel. Bossuet, one of those rare
spirits which prophesy truly, realized this. He
said:</p>

<p>“Jesus Christ came into the world to overthrow
all that pride has established in it; thence it is
that his policy is in direct opposition to that of
the age.”</p>

<p>But this constant, active work of the gospel,
although formerly acknowledged, is now denied
by many; this gives to realism the harshness of
its methods. The realist should acknowledge the
present, abiding influence of the spirit of the
gospel in the world. He should, above all, possess
the religious sentiment; it will give him the
charity he needs. The spirit of charity loses its
influence in literature the moment it withdraws
from its true source.</p>

<p>To sum up what realism should be, I must seek
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
a general formula, which will express both its
method and the extent of its creative power. I
can find but one, and it is a very old one; but
I know of none better, more scientific, or which
approaches nearer the secret of all <span class="lock">creation:—</span></p>

<p>“And the Lord formed man of the dust of the
ground.”—But, to complete the formula, and
account for the dual nature of our humanity, we
must add the text: “And breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life, and man became a living
soul—”</p>

<p>This divine spark, derived from the source of
universal life, is the spirit, the active and mysterious
and incomprehensible element of our being,
which baffles all our explanations, and without
which we are nothing. At the point where life
begins, there do we cease to comprehend.</p>

<p>The realist is groping his way, trying his experiments
in the creations of his brain, which
breathe the spirit of truth, and speak with at
least the accent of sincerity and sympathy.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">EPOCHS IN RUSSIAN LITERATURE.</span></h3>

<h4><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> studying those contemporary writers
who alone will reveal to us the true Russian spirit
and character, we must devote a little attention
to their predecessors, in order to understand the
Russian literature in its prolonged infancy, and
its bearing upon that of the present day. We
shall see how everything conspired to retard its
development. Russian literature may be divided
into four distinct epochs. The first, ending with
the accession of Peter the Great, was in fact its
mediæval age. In this epoch a wealth of national
traditions had accumulated in its popular poetry
and barbarous essays. The second period embraces
the last century, from Peter the Great to
Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, and, although seemingly progressive,
was the least fruitful one, because its literature
was but a servile imitation of that of the
Occident. The third, the short epoch of romanticism,
produced a brilliant set of poets, whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
works were of value to the general world of letters.
But they were hot-house blooms, produced by a
culture imported from abroad, and give but little
idea of the true properties of their native soil.</p>

<p>Forty years ago a new epoch began. Russia
has finally produced something spontaneous and
original. In the realistic novel, Russian genius
has at last come to a realizing sense of its own
existence; and, while bound indissolubly to the
past, it already lisps and stammers the programme
of its future. We shall see how this genius has
soared from darkness and obscurity, acting already
a part in history, although continually repressed
by history’s cruel wrongs and injustice and its
brusque changes of situation. We must recall too
the intellectual origin of this race and its moral
peregrinations, and then we can make more allowance
for what there is of gloom, irresolution,
and obscurity in its literature.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Russian people are afflicted with a national,
a historical malady, which is partly hereditary,
partly contracted during the course of its
existence. The hereditary part is that proclivity
of the Slavonic mind towards that negative
doctrine which to-day we call Nihilism, and which
the Hindu fathers called <dfn>Nirvâna</dfn>. In fact, if we
would understand Russia well, we must recall to
our minds what she has learned from ancient India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
Many philosophers of the present day in Russia
fully accept the doctrines of Buddha, and boast
with pride of the purity of their Aryan blood,
bringing forward many arguments in support of
this claim. First, there is the fact that the physical
type is very marked in families in which the
Tartar blood has never mingled. Many a Moscow
student or peasant from certain provinces might,
except for his light complexion, easily pass in a
street of Lahore or Benares for a native of the
valley of the Ganges. Moreover, they have strong
philological arguments. The old Slavonic dialect
is declared by linguists to more nearly approach
the Sanscrit than does the Greek of the very
earliest epochs. The grammatical rules are identical.
Speak of the <dfn>Vêda</dfn> to any Russian peasant,
and you will find he needs no explanation; the verb
<dfn>vêdat</dfn> is one in constant use by him. If he should
mention the word “fire,” it will be the original
one used by his ancestors who worshipped that
element. Numberless examples could be quoted
to prove this close relation to the original Sanscrit;
but this is still more strongly shown by an
analytical study of the Russian mind and character.
The Hindu type of mind may be easily recognized
in the Slavonic intellectual type. By studying
the revolutions of India one could easily
understand possible convulsions in Russia. The
most able authors state the Buddhist revolution
to have arisen from a social rather than a religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
reaction of the popular sentiment against the spirit
of caste, against the fixed organizations of society.
Like Christianity in the West, Buddhism was in
the extreme East the revelation, the personification
of charity and meekness, of moral and social
freedom, which were to render life more tolerable
to multitudes of human beings bowed under the
yoke of an implacable theocracy.</p>

<p>The best doctrines, in order to succeed, must
permit certain exaggerations for the fanciful and
imaginative, and tolerate certain errors which
attract minds warped by prolonged sufferings. To
the latter, Christianity offers asceticism; Buddhism
promises them the joys of annihilation,
the Nirvâna. Nihilism is the word invented by
Burnouf as a translation of <dfn>Nirvâna</dfn>. Max
Müller says that the Sanscrit word really means
“the action of extinguishing a light by blowing
it out.” Will not this definition explain
Russian Nihilism, which would extinguish the
light of civilization by stifling it, then plunge
back into chaos.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, numerous and more recent causes
have acted upon the national mind producing
this peculiar state of discouragement, which in
violent natures has developed into a furious
desire to destroy every existing condition, because
all are bad. Moreover, Christianity has lent a
new formula to what there was of good in the
old instincts. Its influence has been profound,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
accounting for the spirit of fraternity and self-sacrifice
so admirable in this people. But I cannot
help thinking that with this stolid race we
must go back to the habits of thought of very
ancient times in order to realize what their natural
inclinations and difficulties would be.</p>

<p>We shall now see how these have been aggravated
or modified by a series of accidents. I
know of no people which has been so overwhelmed
by its own fate; like a river which has
changed its course over and over again, or the life
of one of those men who seem fated to begin
several different careers in life and succeed in
none.</p>

<p>The Western nations have developed under
much more favorable conditions. After the
forced establishment and final withdrawal of
Islamism, they enjoyed a long period of comparative
peace, several centuries in which they
could work out the problem of life. Constant
revolutions and wars did not wholly throw
them off the track which they had marked out
for themselves from the outset.</p>

<p>Russia, on the contrary, seems to have offered
a free field for the most radical experiments, in
which its poor people have been involved every
two or three hundred years, just as they were
well started in a new direction. Plunged into
the most barbarous and heathenish anarchy, different
tribes waged war there for two or three
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
centuries after these had wholly ceased in France.
Then Christianity came, but from a Byzantine,
the least pure source; a vitiated Christianity,
enervated by oriental corruption. The Russian
people were fated to become wholly Greek in
religion, laws, and government, thus commencing
a new epoch in history. Would this germ of a
new life have time to develop?</p>

<p>Two hundred years after the baptisms at Kiev,
Russia was overwhelmed by the Mongolian invasion.
Asia returned to demand its prey and to
seize the young Christian territory, which was
already gravitating toward Europe. Pagans from
the beginning, the Tartars became Mohammedans,
remained wholly Asiatic, and introduced oriental
customs among their Russian subjects. Not until
the fifteenth century, when the Renaissance was
dawning upon western Europe, did Russia begin
to throw off this Tartar yoke. They freed themselves
by a succession of strong efforts, but very
gradually. The Crescent did not disappear from
the Volga until 1550, leaving behind it traces of
the oriental spirit for all time.</p>

<p>The Russian people were now crushed by an
iron despotism, made up of Mongolian customs
and Byzantine ceremonies. Just emancipated from
foreign oppression, they were forced to cultivate
the soil. Boris Godunof condemned them to
serfdom, by which their whole social condition
was changed in one day, with one stroke of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
pen,—that unfortunate St. George’s day which
the <dfn>muzhik</dfn> would curse for three hundred years
to come.</p>

<p>In the next century Russia was invaded from
the Occident. Poland obtained one-half of its
territory and ruled at Moscow. The Poles were
afterwards expelled, when the nation could take
time to breathe and assert itself again. Naturally,
it then turned toward Asia and its own
traditions.</p>

<p>Now appeared upon the scene a rough pilot in
the person of Peter the Great, to guide the helm
of this giant raft which was floating at random,
and direct it toward Europe. At this epoch
occurred the strangest of all the experiments
tried by history upon Russia. To continue the
figure, imagine a ship guided towards the West
by the captain and his officers, while the entire
crew were bent upon sailing for the East. Such
was the strange condition of affairs for one hundred
and fifty years, from the accession of Peter
to the death of the Emperor Nicholas; the consequences
of which condition are still observable.
The sovereign and a few men he called to his aid
abjured oriental life entirely, and became Europeans
in ideas, politics, language, and dress. Little
by little, the upper classes followed this example
during the latter part of the last century.</p>

<p>During the first half of the present one, the
influence of Europe became still stronger, affecting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
administration, education, etc., drawing a
small part of the masses with it; but the nation
remained stolid, rebellious, with its eyes turned
toward the East, as were the prayers of their
Tartar masters. Only forty years ago the Western
light illumined the highest peaks alone, while
the broad valleys lay buried in the shadows of a
past which influences them still.</p>

<p>This entire period presents a condition of affairs
wholly unique. An immense population was led
by a small class which had adopted foreign ideas
and manners, and even spoke a strange language;
a class which received its whole intellectual, moral,
and political food and impetus from Germany,
England, or France, as the case might be;—always
from outside. The management of the
land itself was frequently confided to foreigners—“pagans,”
as the Russian peasants called them.
Naturally, these foreigners looked upon this
country as a vast field open to them for the
collection of taxes and recruits; and whose destiny
it was to furnish them with everything
necessary in carrying out their projects,—their
diplomatic combinations on the chess-board of all
Europe.</p>

<p>There were, of course, some exceptions—some
attempts at restoring national politics and interior
reform; but total ignorance of the country as
well as of its language was the rule. Grandparents
are still living in Russia, who, while they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
speak French perfectly, are quite incapable of
speaking, or at least of writing, in the language
of their grandchildren.</p>

<p>Since the time of Catherine, a series of generations
living in the Parisian elegance and luxury
of the days of Louis XV., of the Empire, and the
Restoration, have suffered with the French all their
revolutionary shocks, shared in all their aspirations,
been influenced by all their literature, sympathized
in all their theories of administration
and political economy;—and these do not even
trouble themselves to know how a <dfn>muzhik</dfn> of the
provinces lives, or what he has to endure. These
political economists do not even know how Russian
wheat is raised, which Pushkin declares to
grow differently from the English wheat.</p>

<p>So the people, left to themselves, merely vegetated,
and developed according to the obscure
laws of their oriental nature. We can imagine
what disorder would arise in a nation so formed
and divided.</p>

<p>In France, historical events have gradually
formed a middle class; a natural connecting link
between the two extremes of society. In Russia
this middle class did not exist, and is still wanting,
there being nothing to fill the intervening
space. The whole depth of the abyss was
realized by those Russians who became enlightened
enough to understand the state of their
country during the latter years of the reign of
Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
A national fusion was developed, as it usually is
on the battle-fields, where the Russians fell side by
side before the invader. This movement, however,
was very gradual, and Russia was virtually
divided into two distinct classes until the death
of the Emperor Nicholas, when the necessity of a
more orderly condition of affairs was universally
felt, giving rise to a social revolution which
resulted in the emancipation of the serfs.</p>

<p>For the last quarter of a century, every conscientious
and strong-minded man has worked to
perform his part towards the common object:
the establishment of a solid and united country.
But they met with terrible obstacles; for they
must abolish the past, heal all differences, and
conciliate all parties.</p>

<p>As a world travelling through space, drawn by
opposite attractions, is divided, bursts asunder,
one fragment rushing to join the distant star
which calls it, while the greater portion of the
planet continues to gravitate towards the nearer
spheres; and as, in spite of all opposing forces,
these two separated fragments of a world tend to
re-unite, no matter what spaces divide them, or
with what a shock they must meet, having
acquired such increased velocity;—so was it
with Russia, made up of so many dissimilar elements,
attracted at different times by opposite
poles; now tossed from Europe to Asia, and
back again from Asia to Europe, and finally
divided against itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
This condition is what I called the Russian
national malady, which has plunged this people
into the deepest discouragement and confusion.
To historical misfortunes, we may add the peculiarities
of soil and climate in which the Russian
drama has been enacted. The severe, interminable
winter interrupts man’s work and depresses his
spirit. In the southern part, the scanty vegetation
does not incite him to wrestle with nature and vie
with her in energy and devotion. Is it not true that
man’s mind is modelled according to the nature
of his abiding-place? Must not a country having
a limited horizon, and forms strongly and sharply
defined, tend to the development of individuality,
to clearness of conception, and persevering effort?
The larger portion of Russia has nothing analogous
to this; only, as Tacitus says, a “monotonous
alternation of wild wood and reeking marsh.”
(“<i lang="la">Aut silvis horrida, aut paludibus fœda</i>”); endless
plains with no distinct horizon, no decisive
outlines, only a mirage of snow, marsh, or sand.
Everywhere the infinite, which confuses the mind
and attracts it hopelessly. Tolstoï has well described
it as “that boundless horizon which
appeals to me so strongly.”</p>

<p>The souls of this people must resemble those
who sail on a long voyage; self-centered, resigned
to their situation, with impulses of sudden, violent
longing for the impossible. Their land is made
for a tent-life, rather than for dwelling in houses;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
their ideas are nomadic, like themselves. As the
winds bear the arctic cold over the plains from
the White Sea to the Black, without meeting any
resisting obstacle, so invasions, melancholy, famine,
servitude, seize and fill these empty stretches
rapidly and without hindrance. It is a land
which is calculated to nourish the dim, hereditary,
confused aspirations of the Russian heart,
rather than those productions of the mind which
give an impetus to literature and the arts.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we shall see how the persistent
seed will develop under this severe sky and amid
such untoward influences, saved by the eternal
spring which exists in all human hearts of every
climate.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><br>
</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> middle age of Russian literature, or the
period ending with the accession of Peter the
Great, produced first: ecclesiastical literature,
comprising sermons, chronicles, moral and instructive
treatises. Secondly: popular literature,
consisting of epic poems, characteristic sonnets
and legends. The former resembles that of
western Europe, being in the same vein, only
inferior to it.</p>

<p>Throughout Christendom, the Church was
for a long time the only educator; monk and
scholar being almost synonymous words; while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
outside the pale of the Church all was barbarism.
At first, the writer was a mere mechanical
laborer, or Chinese scribe, who laboriously copied
the Gospels and the ancient Scriptures. He was
respected as possessing one of the arcana of life,
and as specially gifted through a miracle from on
high. Many generations of monks passed away
before the idea occurred to these humble copyists
to utilize their art in recording their own personal
impressions. At first there were homilies, mere
imitations of those of the Byzantine fathers; then
lives of saints; and the legendary lore of the monastery
of Kiev, the great centre of prayer and holy
travail of the whole Slavonic world. Here originated
the first approach to romance of that time,
its Golden Legend, the first effort of the imagination
towards the ideal which is so seductive to
every human soul. Then came the chronicles of
wars, and of their attendant and consequent evils.
Nestor, the father of Russian history, noted down
his impressions of what he saw, in a style similar
to that of Gregory of Tours.</p>

<p>From the thirteenth to the fifteenth century,
these feeble germs of culture were nearly crushed
out of existence by the Tartar invasion; and even
the translation of the Bible into the Slavonic language
was not accomplished until the year 1498.</p>

<p>In 1518, Maximus, a Greek monk, who had
lived in Florence with Savonarola, came to Moscow,
bringing with him the first specimens of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
printing. He reformed the schools, and collected
around him a group of men eager for knowledge.
About this time the so-called civil deacons, the
embryo of future <dfn>tchinovnism</dfn>,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> began to assist
the students of Latin and Greek in their translations.</p>

<p>Father Sylvester also wrote the “Domostroi,” a
treatise on morals and domestic economy; a practical
encyclopædia for Russians of the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>In the second half of this century Ivan the
Terrible introduced printing into Russia. A
part of the venerable building he erected at
Moscow for a printing establishment is still
standing. He tried to obtain from Germany
skilful hands in the new art, but they were refused
him. Each sovereign jealously guarded
every master of the great secret, as they did good
alchemists or skilful workers in metals.</p>

<p>A Moscow student, Ivan Fedorof, cast some
Slavonic characters, and used them in printing
the Acts of the Apostles, in 1564. This is the
most ancient specimen of typography in Russia.
He, the first of Russian printers, was accused of
heresy, and obliged to fly for his life. His
wretched existence seemed a prophetic symbol
of the destiny reserved for the development of
thought in his native country. Fedorof took
refuge with some magnates of Lithuania, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
printed some books in their castles; but his
patrons and protectors tore him from his beloved
work, and forced him to cultivate the land. He
wrote of himself:—“It was not my work to sow
the grain, but to scatter through the earth food
for the mind, nourishment for the souls of all
mankind.” He fled to Lemberg, where he died
in extreme poverty, leaving his precious treasure
to a Jew.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century produced a few specimens
of secular literature. But it was an unfavorable
time, a time of anxiety, of usurpations; and
afterwards came the Polish invasion. When intellectual
life again awoke, theological works were
the order of the day; and even up to the time of
Peter the Great, all the writers of note were theologians.</p>

<p>The development of general literature in Russia
was precisely analogous to that of Western
Europe, only about two centuries later, the seventeenth
century in Russia corresponding to the
fifteenth in France. With popular literature, or
folk-lore, however, the case is quite otherwise;
nowhere is it so rich and varied as with the
Slavonians.</p>

<p>Nature and history seem to have been too
cruel to this people. Their spirits rise in rebellion
against their condition, and soar into that
fantastic realm of the imagination, above and outside
the material world; a realm created by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Divine Being for the renewal of man’s spirit, and
giving him an opportunity for the play of his
fancy. According to the poet Tutschef, “Our
earthly life is bathed in dreams, as the earth by
ocean’s waves.” Their songs and myths are the
music of history, embracing their whole national
life, and changing it into dreams and fancies.
The Cossack fisher-folk have sung them upon
their mighty rivers for more than eight centuries.</p>

<p>When, in the future, Russia shall produce her
greatest and truest poets, they have only to draw
from these rich sources, an inexhaustible store.
Never can they find better material; for the imagination
of that anonymous author, the people, is
the more sublime, and its heart more truly poetical,
because of its great faith, simplicity, and
many sorrows. What poem can compare with
that description of the universe in a book, written
in the fifteenth century, called “Book of the
<span class="lock">Dove”?—</span></p>

<p>“The sun is the fire of love glowing in the
Lord’s face; the stars fall from his mantle….
The night is dark with his thoughts; the break
of day is the glance of his eye….”</p>

<p>And where can the writers of the modern
realistic Russian novel find tenderer touches or
more sharply bitter allusions than in the old
dramatic poem, “The Ascension of Christ”?
Jesus, as he is about to rise to heaven, thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
consoles the sorrowing crowd clustered around
<span class="lock">him:—</span></p>

<p>“Weep not, dear brethren! I will give you a
mountain of gold, a river of honey; I will leave
you gardens planted with vines, fruits, and manna
from heaven.” But the Apostle John interrupts
him, <span class="lock">saying:—</span></p>

<p>“Do not give them the mountain of gold, for
the princes and nobles will take it from them,
divide it among themselves, and not allow our
brothers to approach. If thou wishest these
unfortunates to be fed, clothed, and sheltered,
bestow upon them Thy Holy Name, that they may
glorify it in their lives, on their wanderings
through the earth.”</p>

<p>The song of “The Band of Igor,” an epic poem,
describing the struggle with the pagan hordes
from the south-west, and supposed by some
authors to have been inspired by Homer, is the
most ancient, and the prototype of all others of
the Middle Age. The soul of the Slavonic poet of
this time is Christian only in name. The powers
he believes in are those of nature and the
universe. He addresses invocations to the rivers,
to the sea, to darkness, the winds, the sun. The
continual contrast between the beneficent Light
and the evil Darkness recalls the ancient Egyptian
hymns, which always describe the eternal contest
between day and night.</p>

<p>Pushkin says of the “Song of Igor,” the origin of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
which is much disputed among scholars: “All our
poets of the eighteenth century together had not
poetry enough in them to comprehend, still less
to compose, a single couplet of this ‘Song of
Igor.’”</p>

<p>This epic poetry of Russia strikes its roots in
the most remote antiquity of Asia, from Hindu
and Persian myths, as well as from those of the
Occident. It resembles the race itself in its
growth and mode of development, oscillating
alternately between the east and the west.
Thus has the Russian mind oscillated between the
two poles of attraction. In this period of its
growth, it remembers and imitates more than it
creates; but the foreign images it receives and
reflects assume larger contours and more melancholy
colors; a tinge of plaintiveness, as well as
of brotherly love and sympathy.</p>

<p>Not so with the period we now enter. Literature
is now reduced to a restricted form, like the
practice of an art, cultivated for itself and following
certain rules. It is an edifice constructed by
Peter the Great, in which the author becomes a
servant of the state, with a set task like the rest
of the government officials. All must study in
the school of Western Europe, and must accomplish
in the eighteenth century what France did
in the sixteenth. Even the Slavonic language
itself must suffer innovations and adopt foreign
terms. Before this, all books were written in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the Old Slavonic language of the church, which
influenced also all scientific and poetical productions.</p>

<p>The change which came about naturally in
France, as the result of an intellectual revolution,
for which the minds of the people were already
ripe, was in Russia brought about by a single
will; being the artificial work of one man who
aroused the people from slumber before their
time.</p>

<p>A new style of literature cannot be called into
being, as an army can be raised, or a new code of
laws established, by an imperial order or decree.
Let us imagine the Renaissance established in
France by Philippe le Bel! Such an attempt was
now made in Russia, and its unsatisfactory results
are easily accounted for.</p>

<p>Peter established an Academy of Science at St.
Petersburg, sending its members abroad for a time
at first to absorb all possible knowledge, and
return to use it for the benefit of the Russian
people. This custom prevailed for more than a
century. The most important of these scholars
was Lomonosof, the son of a poor fisherman of
the White Sea. Having distinguished himself at
school, he was taken up by the government and
sent into Germany. Returning to supplant the
German professors, whom he found established at
St. Petersburg, he bequeathed to his country a
quite remarkable epic poem on Peter the Great,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
called “La Pétriade,” for which his name is
revered by his countrymen.</p>

<p>The glorious reign of Catherine <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> should have
added something to the literary world. She was
a most extraordinary woman. She wrote comedies
for her own theatre at the Hermitage, as
well as treatises on education for the benefit of
her grandchildren, and would gladly have been
able to furnish native philosophers worthy to vie
with her foreign courtiers; but they proved mere
feeble imitators of Voltaire. Kheraskof wrote the
“Rossiade” and Sumarokof, called by his contemporaries
the Russian Racine, furnished the court
with tragedies. But two comedies, “Le Brigadier,”
and “Le Mineur,” by Von Vizin, have
more merit, and are still much read and highly
appreciated. These form a curious satire on the
customs of the time. But the name of Derzhavin
eclipses all others of this epoch. His works were
modelled somewhat after Rousseau and Lefranc de
Pompignan, and are fully equal to them.</p>

<p>Derzhavin had the good-fortune to live to a
ripe old age, and in court life through several
reigns; thus having the best of opportunities to
utilize all striking events. Each new accession to
the throne, victories, anniversaries, all contributed
to inflate his national pride and inspire his muse.</p>

<p>But his high-flown rhetoric is open to severe
criticism, and his works will be chiefly valued
as illustrative of a glorious period of Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
history, and as a memorial of the illustrious Catherine.
Pushkin says of <span class="lock">him:—</span></p>

<p>“He is far inferior to Lomonosof.—He neither
understood the grammar nor the spirit of our language;
and in time, when his works will have
been translated, we shall blush for him. We
should reserve only a few of his odes and
sketches, and burn all the rest.”</p>

<p>Krylof, the writer of fables in imitation of La
Fontaine, deserves mention. He had talent enough
to show some originality in a style of literature
in which it is most difficult to be original; and
wrote with a rude simplicity characteristically
Russian, and in a vein much more vigorous than
that of his model.</p>

<p>Karamzin inaugurated a somewhat novel deviation
in the way of imitation. He was an
enthusiastic admirer of Rousseau. He was poet,
critic, political economist, novelist, and historian;
and bore a leading part in the literature of the
latter part of the eighteenth century and the
beginning of the nineteenth; a time including
the end of Catherine’s reign and the early part
of Alexander’s. It was a transition period between
the classic and romantic schools of literature.
Karamzin might be called the Rousseau and
the Chateaubriand of his country. His voluminous
history of Russia is of great merit, although
he is sufficiently blinded by his patriotism to cause
him to present a too flattering picture of a most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
cruel despotism; so that his assertions are often
challenged by later writers. But the work is of
great value as a most conscientious compilation of
events and quotations, and the only one written
up to the last twenty years; and in this respect
Karamzin has no rival.</p>

<p>He owed his renown, before writing his history,
to a few little romances of a sentimental turn.
The romantic story of “La pauvre Lise” especially
was received with a furor quite out of
proportion to its merit. Its popularity was such
that it became the inspiration of artists and of
decorators of porcelain. Lakes and ponds innumerable
were baptized with the name of <i>Lise</i>, in
memory of her sad fate. Such enthusiasm seems
incredible; but we can never tell what literary
effort may be borne on to undying fame by the
wheel of fashion!</p>

<p>The successive efforts of these secondary writers
have contributed much to form the language of
Russian literature as it now exists; Karamzin
for its prose, Derzhavin for its poetry. In less
than one hundred years the change was accomplished,
and the way prepared for Pushkin, who
was destined to supply an important place in Russian
literature.</p>

<p>Karamzin’s part in politics was quite at variance
with his position in the world of letters.
Although an imitator of Rousseau, he set himself
against the liberal ideas of Alexander. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
was opposed to the emancipation of the serfs, and
became the champion of the so-called <dfn>Muscovitism</dfn>,
which, forty years later, became <dfn>Slavophilism</dfn>. He
lived in Moscow, where the conservative element
was strongest, acting in opposition to Speranski,
the prime minister.</p>

<p>In 1811, Karamzin wrote a famous paper, addressed
to his sovereign, called, “Old and New
Russia,” which so influenced Alexander’s vacillating
mind that it gave the death-blow to
Speranski. In this paper he says: “We are
anticipating matters in Russia, where there are
hardly one hundred persons who know how to
spell correctly. We must return to our national
traditions, and do away with all ideas imported
from the Occident. No Russian can comprehend
any limitation of the autocratic power. The
autocrat draws his wisdom from a fountain within
himself, and from the love of his people,” etc.</p>

<p>This paper contained the germ of every future
demand of the Muscovite party.</p>

<p>Karamzin is the pioneer of the <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> party,
which would do away with all the reforms of
Peter the Great, and reconstruct the original
Russia as an ideal government, entirely free from
any European ideas. As this political programme
became a literary one, it is important to note its
first appearance.</p>

<p>Freemasonry, that embodiment of the spirit of
mysticism, worked its way into Russia, brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
from Sweden and Germany, during the reign of
Catherine; and was at once taken up by the literary
world, then led by Novikof. The greater
part of the distinguished scholars and statesmen
under Alexander, Karamzin among them, were
interested in it, and spread through the country
the philosophical works which deluged Europe.</p>

<p>The French Revolution now broke out; and
Catherine, becoming alarmed at the rapid spread
of the new philosophy, ordered the lodges closed,
had the suspicious books seized, and Novikof
tried and condemned.</p>

<p>But the new doctrines assumed greater force
under Alexander, who encouraged them. The
infatuation for this mysticism spread among all
intelligent people. The state of mind of the
upper classes has been faithfully depicted in the
character of Pierre Bezushof, in “War and
Peace,” the historical novel of Leon Tolstoï.
(See the chapter which describes Pierre’s initiation
into Freemasonry.) This condition of mind
is not peculiar to the Russians. All Europe was
obscured by it at the end of the eighteenth century;
but in Russia it found free scope in the
unsettled and confused state of affairs, where the
thinking mind struggled against the influx of
rationalism, while unwilling to accept the negative
philosophy of the learned class. On this
account, among others, the reign of Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
presents a curious subject for study and contemplation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
It offered a point of meeting for every
new current of thought which agitated Russia,
as well as for everything that had been repressed
throughout the reign of Nicholas. The Masonic
lodges insensibly became a moving power in politics,
which led to the liberal conspiracy crushed
out in 1825. A horror of the revolutionary ideas
of France, and the events of 1812, had produced
a great change in the Russian mind; besides,
Russia, now temporarily estranged from France,
became more influenced by Germany; which fact
was destined to have a considerable effect upon
their literature. During the whole of the eighteenth
century, France tutored the Russian mind
in imitation of the classics. It now became inculcated
with the romanticism of Germany.</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><br>
<br>
<span class="allsmcap">ROMANTICISM.—PUSHKIN AND POETRY.</span>
</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Russia</span>—all Europe, in fact—was now enjoying
a period of peace. A truce of twenty-five
years lay between the great political wars and the
important social struggles to come. During these
years of romanticism, so short and yet so full,
between 1815 and 1840 only, all intelligent minds
in Russia seemed given up to thought, imagination,
and poetry.</p>

<p>Everything in this country develops suddenly.
Poets appear in numbers, just as the flowers of
the field spring forth after the sun’s hot rays have
melted the snow. At this time poetry seemed
to be the universal language of men. Only one of
this multitude of poets, however, is truly admirable,
absorbing all the rest in the lustrous rays of
his genius,—the glorious Pushkin.</p>

<p>He was preceded by Zhukovski, who was born
twenty years earlier, and who also survived him.
No critic can deny that Zhukovski was the real
originator of romanticism in Russian literature;
or that he was the first one to introduce it from
Germany. His works were numerous. Perfectly
acquainted with the Greek language, his version
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
of Homer is most admirable. He also wrote several
poems in the style of Schiller, Goethe, and
Uhland; and many compositions, ballads, etc., all
in the German style. He touched upon many
Russian subjects, themes which Pushkin afterwards
took up. In fact, he was to Pushkin what
Perugino was to Raphael; yet every Russian will
declare that the new romanticism of that time
dates from Pushkin, and is identified with him.</p>

<p>Zhukovski was one of those timid spirits which
are born to be satellites, even though they rise
before the sun in the pale dawn; but they only
shine with reflected light, and their lustre becomes
wholly absorbed in the rays of the rising luminary
which replaces them.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>To realize the importance of the part the poets
of this period were destined to play, we must
remember what a very small part of the population
of this vast country could be called the
educated class. At the beginning of the century,
the education of the Muscovite aristocracy was
confided entirely to the Jesuits, who had been
powerfully supported by the Emperor Paul. In
1811, Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> replaced these foreign educators
by native Russians, and founded the Lyceum
of Tsarskoe-Selo, after the model of the Paris
Lyceums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Students were admitted according to birth and
merit only. Pushkin and Gortchakof were the
two who most distinguished themselves. The
course of study was rather superficial. The students
were on intimate terms with the soldiers
of the Imperial Guard, and quartered in the
imperial palace with them. Politics, patriotism,
poetry, all together fomented an agitation, which
ended with the conspiracy of December, 1825.</p>

<p>Pushkin was at once recognized as a master in
this wild throng, and was already famous as a
poet. The old Derzhavin cast his own mantle
upon Pushkin’s shoulders and pronounced him
his heir. Pushkin possessed the gift of pleasing;
but to understand his genius, we must not lose
sight of his origin. His maternal grandfather was
an Abyssinian negro, who had been a slave in the
Seraglio of Constantinople, was stolen and carried
to Russia by a corsair, and adopted by Peter the
Great, who made him a general, and gave him in
marriage to a noble lady of the court. The poet
inherited some of his grandfather’s features; his
thick lips, white teeth, and crisp curly hair. This
drop of African blood, falling amid Arctic snows,
may account for the strong contrasts and exaggerations
of his poetic nature, which was a remarkable
union of impetuosity and melancholy.</p>

<p>His youth was passed in a wild whirl of pleasure
and excess. He incurred while still young
the imperial anger, by having written some insolent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
verses, as well as by committing some foolish
pranks with some of the saints’ images; and was
banished for a time to the borders of the Black
Sea, where, enchanted by the delicious climate
and scenery, his genius developed rapidly.</p>

<p>He returned not much the wiser, but with his
genius fully matured at the age of twenty-five.
For a few short years following his return, he
produced his greatest masterpieces with astonishing
rapidity, and died at thirty-seven in a duel,
the victim of an obscure intrigue. He had married
a very beautiful woman, who was the innocent
cause of his death. Lending an ear to certain
calumnies concerning her, he became furiously
jealous, and fought the fatal duel with an officer
of the Russian guard.</p>

<p>While we lament his sad fate, we can but reflect
that the approach of age brings sadness with it,
and most of all to a poet. He died young, in the
prime of life and in the plenitude of his powers,
giving promise of future possible masterpieces,
with which we always credit such geniuses.</p>

<p>It is impossible to judge of this man’s works
from a review of his character. Though his heart
was torn by the stormiest passions, he possessed
an intellect of the highest order, truly classic in
the best sense of the word. When his talent
became fully matured, form took possession of
him rather than color. In his best poems, intellect
presides over sentiment, and the soul of the
artist is laid bare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
To attempt to quote, to translate his precious
words, would be a hopeless task. He himself said:
“In my opinion, there is nothing more difficult, I
might say impossible, than to translate Russian
poetry into French; concise as our language is,
we can never be concise enough.”</p>

<p>In Latin one might possibly be able to express
as many thoughts in as few words, and as beautifully.
The charm vanishes with the translator’s
touch; besides, the principal object of this book
is to show how the peculiar type of Russian character
is manifested in the works of the Russian
writers. Neither do I think that Pushkin could aid
us much in this study; although he was no servile
imitator, like so many of his predecessors, it is
none the less true that he drew his material from
the great sources of European literature. He
was educated from a child in French literature.
His father knew Molière by heart, and his uncle
was a great admirer of Béranger. When he entered
the Lyceum he could scarcely speak his
mother-tongue, but he had been fed with Voltaire
from early childhood. His very first verses
were written in French, and his first Russian
rhymes were madrigals on the same themes. In
the “Prisoner of the Caucasus,” written in 1824,
we can feel the influence of Byron, whom he
calls the “master of his thoughts.” Gradually
he acquired more originality, but it is quite certain
that but for Byron some of the most important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of his poems, such as “Onyegin,” “The Bohemians,”
several of his oriental poems, and even
his admirable “Poltava,” would never have
existed.</p>

<p>During the latter years of his life, he had a
passion for history, when he studied the historical
dramas of Shakespeare. This he himself
acknowledges in the preface to “Boris Godunof,”
which is a Shakespearian drama on a Muscovite
subject. In certain prose works he shows unmistakable
proofs of the influence of Voltaire, as
they are written in a style wholly dissimilar to
anything in Russian prose.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> party like to imagine that
Pushkin, in his “Songs of the Western Slavs,”
has evoked the ancient Russian spirit; while he
has merely translated some French verses into
Russian. We must acknowledge the truth that
his works, with the exception of “Onyegin,” and a
few others, do not exhibit any peculiar ethnical
stamp. He is influenced at different times, as
the case may be, by his contemporaries in Germany,
England, and France. He expresses universal
sentiments, and applies them to Russian
themes; but he looks from outside upon the
national life, like all his contemporaries in letters,
artistically free from any influence of his own race.
Compare his descriptions of the Caucasus with
those of Tolstoï in “The Cossacks.” The poet
of 1820 looks upon nature and the Orientals with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the eye of a Byron or a Lamartine; while the
observer of 1850 regards that spot of Asia as his
ancestral mother-country, and feels that it partly
belongs to him.</p>

<p>We shall find that Pushkin’s successors possess
none of his literary qualities. He is as
concise as they are diffuse; as clear as they are
involved. His style is as perfect, elegant, and
correct as a Greek bronze; in a word, he has
style and good taste, which terms cannot be applied
to any of his successors in Russian literature.
Is it taking away anything from Pushkin to
remove him from his race and give him to the
world and humanity at large? Because he was
born in Russia, there is nothing whatever to
prove that his works were thereby modified.
He would have sung in the self-same way for
England, France, or Italy.</p>

<p>But, although he resembles his country so little,
he served it well. He stirred its intellectual life
more effectively than any other writer has done;
and it is not too much to call him the Peter the
Great of Russian literature. The nation gratefully
recognizes this debt. To quote one of his
own verses:—“The monument I have erected
for myself is made by no mortal hand; and the
grass will not have time to grow in the path that
leads to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Among the group of poets contemporaries of
Pushkin only two are really worthy of mention,
viz.: Griboyedof and Lermontof; but these two,
although they died young, gave promise of great
genius. The first of these left only one comedy,
but that is the masterpiece of the Russian
drama (“le Mal de Trop d’Esprit”). The
author, unlike Pushkin, disdained all foreign
literature, took pride in all the ancient Muscovite
customs, and was Russian to the backbone.
He painted the people and the peculiarities of his
own country only, and so wonderfully well that
his sayings have become proverbs. The piece is
similar to the “Revizor” of Gogol, but, in my
opinion, superior to it, being broader in spirit and
finer in sentiment. Moreover, its satire never
will grow old, for it is as appropriate to the present
day as to the time for which it was written.</p>

<p>Returning from Persia, where he had been sent
as Russian minister to the Shah, he was murdered
by a party of robbers, at the age of thirty
four.</p>

<p>Lermontof was the poet of the Caucasus, which
he made the scene of all his poems. His short
life of twenty-six years was spent among those
mountains; and he was, like Pushkin, killed in a
duel, just as he was beginning to be recognized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
as a worthy successor to him. Byron was also
his favorite model, whom he, unhappily, strongly
resembled in character. His most celebrated
poem was “The Demon”; but he wrote many
most picturesque and fascinating stanzas and
short pieces, which are full of tenderness and
melancholy. Though less harmonious and perfect
than Pushkin’s, his verses give out sometimes
a sadder ring. His prose is equal to his
poetry, and many of his short sketches, illustrative
of Caucasian life, possess a subtle charm.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Lermontof was the last and most extreme of
the poets of the romantic period. The Byronic
fever, now at its height, was destined soon to die
out and disappear. Romanticism sought in history
some more solid aliment than despair. A reaction
set in; and writers of elegies and ballads
turned their attention to historical dramas and
the picturesque side of human life. From Byron
they turned back to Shakespeare, the universal
Doctor. Pushkin, in his “Boris Godunof,” and
in the later poems of his mature period, devoted
himself to this resurrection of the past; and his
disciples followed in his wake. The rhetoric of
the new school, not wholly emancipated from
romanticism, was naturally somewhat conventional.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
But Pushkin became interested in journalism;
and polemics, social reforms, and many
other new problems arising, helped to make
romanticism a thing of the past. The young
schools of philosophy found much food for thought
and controversy. The question of the emancipation
of the serfs, raised in the court of Alexander
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, weighed heavily upon the national conscience.
A suffering people cannot be fed upon rhetoric.</p>

<p>In 1836, Tchadayef published his famous
“Lettre Philosophique.” He was a man of the
world, but a learned man and a philosopher.
The fundamental idea of his paper was that Russia
had hitherto been but a parasite, feeding upon
the rest of Europe, and had contributed of itself
nothing useful to civilization; had established no
religious reforms, nor allowed any scope for free
thought upon the leading questions of modern
society. He <span class="lock">said:—</span></p>

<p>“We have in our blood a principle which is
hostile to civilization.”</p>

<p>These were strong sentiments coming from the
mouth of a Russian; but they afterwards found
many echoing voices, which never before had put
such crude truths into words. Tchadayef was
claimed by the liberals as their legitimate father,
his “Lettre Philosophique” was made a political
pamphlet, and he himself was regarded as a revolutionary
leader.</p>

<p>Just at this time, Kant, Schelling, and Hegel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
were translated, and a great many young Russians
now studied rationalism at its fountain-heads,
in the different German universities. The
preceding generation, which had become intoxicated
with sentiment, was followed by a generation
devoted to metaphysics. This new hobby
was ridden with the enthusiasm peculiar to the
Russians, and hairs which in Germany were split
into four parts were subdivided in Moscow into
eight.</p>

<p>A writer nourished on the new doctrines, and
who soon became leader of the liberal school,
appeared at this time, and exercised a strong
influence upon literature. It was the critic Bielinski.
He was, perhaps, the only critic of his
country really worthy of the name. He left a
voluminous work, a perfect encyclopædia of
Russian literature; rich in wisdom and in ideas,
giving a fine historical account of the ancient
literature, and defining with rare sagacity the
tendencies of the new. He threw down many
old idols, and ridiculed the absurd confidence in
the writers of the classic period. In spite of his
admiration for Pushkin, he points out many of the
weak points of romanticism, and seems to fully
realize the intellectual necessities of his time.
The great novelists of modern Russia have been
encouraged by his advice, and he has certainly
shown himself to be a critic in advance of his own
time, and the only one Russia has produced. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
first sketches and tales of Gogol revealed to
Bielinski the birth of this new art. He declared
the age of lyric poetry was past forever, and that
the reign of Russian prose romance had begun.
Everything has justified this great writer’s prophecy.
Since the time of Pushkin, their literature
has undergone wonderful developments.
The novelists no longer draw from outside
sources, but from the natal soil, and it is they
who will show us what a rich verdure can be produced
from under those Arctic snows.</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr><br>
<br>
<span class="allsmcap">THE EVOLUTION OF REALISM IN RUSSIA.—GOGOL.</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first Russian tale or romance was published
in 1799, but nothing of note appeared before
1840; although we have seen what success
Karamzin obtained with his touching romances,
especially with “La Pauvre Lise.” Several historical
romances also appeared about this time,
(1820), inspired, no doubt, by the unprecedented
popularity and success of those of Sir Walter
Scott. But lyric poetry and romanticism had not
lost their influence, and even Pushkin’s little historical
tales savor more of the classic period, and
are rather works of the imagination than studies
from real life. The historical and so-called popular
novel, however, with its superhuman heroes,
was now becoming tedious; and authors were
already appearing who had begun to observe the
life around them attentively, and to take pleasure
in studying something outside of themselves.
The same causes conspired to produce, almost
simultaneously, three writers destined to accomplish
the same task: Dickens in England, Balzac
in France, and Gogol in Russia. Gogol developed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
his work more slowly than the others at first, but
collected rich materials for his successors. He
may be called the first of Russian prose writers;
and we shall see by a study of his character and
works, what a foundation he laid for future progress
in prose literature in his country, and what
stirring controversies his books called forth.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Gogol was a Cossack, from Little Russia or
Ukraine. For Russian readers, that is quite
enough to explain the peculiar qualities of his
mind and its productions, which were characterized
by keen but kindly satire, with a tinge of
melancholy ever running through and underneath
it. He is the natural product of the land which
gave him birth. This frontier country is subject
to the contending influences of both north and
south. For a few short months the sun revels
there and accomplishes an almost miraculous
work—an oriental brilliancy of light by day, and
soft, enchanting nights under a sky resplendent
with stars. Magnificent harvests from the fertile
soil ensure an easy, joyous life; all trouble and
sadness vanish with the melting snow, and spirits
rise to general gayety and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But the boundless spaces, the limitless horizons
of these sunny plains overwhelm the spirit; one
cannot long feel joyous in the presence of Infinity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
The habit of thought becomes like that of the
eye; is lost in space, develops an inclination to
revery, which causes the mind to fall back upon
itself, and the imagination is, so to speak, thrown
inward.</p>

<p>Winter transforms the Russian. Upon the
Dnieper the winter is nearly as severe as on the
Neva. There is nothing to check the icy winds
from the north. Death comes suddenly to claim
its reign. Both earth and man are paralyzed.
Just as Ukraine was subjugated by the armies
of Moscow, so it is taken possession of by the
climate of Moscow. On this great battle-field
nature carries out the plan of this country’s political
history, the vicissitudes of which have no
doubt contributed, as well as those of climate, to
form its own peculiar physiognomy.</p>

<p>Little Russia was at one time overrun by the
Turks; and derived from its long association
with them many oriental traits. Then it was subdued
by Poland, which has transmitted something
of its savage luxury to its vassal. Afterwards the
Cossack leagues established there their republican
spirit of independence. The traditions of this
epoch are dearest of all to the heart of the Little
Russian, who claims from them his inheritance of
wild freedom and prowess. An ancient order of
Cossack chivalry, the Zaporovian League, recruited
from brigands and fugitive serfs, had always been
in constant warfare, obeying no law but that of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
the sword. Families who were descended directly
from this stock (Gogol’s was one of them) inherited
this spirit of revolt, as well as wandering
instincts, and a love of adventure and the marvellous.
The complex elements of this character,
which is more free, jovial, and prompt in action
than that of the native of Russia proper, have
strongly influenced the literature of Russia
through Gogol, whose heart clung with tenacity to
his native soil. In fact, the first half of his life’s
work is a picture of life in Ukraine, with its
legends.</p>

<p>Gogol (Nikolai Vasilievitch) was born near
Poltava in 1809, in the very heart of the Cossack
country. His grandfather, who was his first
teacher, was regimental scribe to the Zaporovian
League.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The child listened from infancy to the
tales of this grandfather, inexhaustible tales of
heroic deeds during the great wars with Poland,
as well as thrilling exploits of these Corsairs of
the Steppes. His young imagination was fed with
these stories, tragedies of military life, and rustic
fairy-tales and legends, which are given to us almost
intact in his “Evenings at the Farm,” and in
his poem of “Taras Bulba.” His whole surroundings
spoke to him of an age of fable not long
past; of a primitive poetry still alive in the customs
of the people. This condensed poetry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
reaches us after passing through two prisms; the
recollections of old age, which recalls while it
regrets the past; and the impressions of a child’s
fancy, which is dazzled by what it hears. This
was the first and perhaps the most profitable part
of the young boy’s education. He was afterwards
put into an institution, where he was taught Latin
and other languages; but, according to his biographers,
he never excelled in scholarship. He
must have made up for lost time later on; for all
his contemporaries speak of his extensive reading
and his perfect familiarity with all the literature
of the Occident.</p>

<p>His letters written to his mother before leaving
school show already the bent of his mind. Keen,
observant, and satirical, his wit is sometimes exercised
at the expense of his comrades. He already
showed signs of a deeply religious nature,
and was ambitious too of a great career. His high
hopes are sometimes temporarily crushed by a sudden
depression or feeling of discouragement, and
in his letters he declaims against the injustice of
men. He feels the pervading influence of the
Byronism of that time. “I feel as if called,” cries
the young enthusiast, “to some great, some noble
task, for the good of my country, for the happiness
of my fellow-citizens and of all mankind.
My soul feels the presence of an angel from
heaven, calling, impelling me towards the lofty
aim I aspire to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
A Russian who lived under the rule of the
Emperor Nicholas, and was eager to work for the
happiness of his fellow-men, had no choice of
means. He must enter the government service, and
laboriously climb the steps of the administrative
hierarchy, which appropriates to itself every force
of the community and nation. Having completed
his studies, Gogol set out for St. Petersburg. It
was in the year 1829, and he was twenty years
of age. With empty pockets, but rich in illusions,
he approached the capital just as his Cossack
ancestors had entered the cities they conquered;
thinking he had only to walk boldly forward and
claim everything he desired. But the future author,
destined to play so prominent a part in the
life and literature of his country, must now put
aside his dreams and taste the stern reality of life.
A few weeks’ experience taught him that the great
capital was for him more of a desert than his native
steppe. He was refused everything he applied for;
for a provincial with no letters of introduction
could expect nothing else. In a fit of despair, he
determined to leave St. Petersburg. One day,
having received a small sum from his mother,
which she had saved to pay off a mortgage on
their house, instead of depositing the money in a
bank, he jumped on board a ship to go—somewhere,
anywhere—forward, into the great world;
like a child who had become imbued with the
spirit of adventure, from reading Robinson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
Crusoe. He left the boat at her first landing-place,
which was Lubeck. Having wandered
about the city for three days, he returned to St.
Petersburg, cured of his folly, and resigned to
bear patiently whatever was in store for him.</p>

<p>With great difficulty he obtained a modest
position in an office connected with the government,
where he only remained one year, but where
he received impressions which were to haunt his
whole future life. It was here that he studied
the model of that wretched hero of his work,
“Le Manteau,” in flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Becoming weary of his occupation, he attempted
acting, but his voice was not thought strong
enough. He then became a tutor in families of
the aristocracy of St. Petersburg; and finally was
appointed to a professorship in the University.
But although he made a brilliant opening
address, his pupils soon complained that he put
them to sleep, and he lost the situation. It was
at this juncture that he took refuge in literature.
He published at first a few modest essays in the
leading journals, which attracted some attention,
and Zhukovski had introduced him to Pushkin.
Gogol has related with what fear and trembling
he rung one morning at the door of the great
poet. Pushkin had not yet risen, having been up
all night, as his valet said. When Gogol begged
to be excused for disturbing one so occupied with
his literary labors, the servant informed him that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
his master had passed the night playing cards.
What a disenchantment for an admirer of the
great poet!</p>

<p>But Gogol was warmly welcomed. Pushkin’s
noble heart, too great for envy, enjoyed the success
of others. His eager sympathy, lavish praise, and
encouragement have produced legions of authors.
Gogol, among them all, was his favorite. At first
he advised him to write sketches descriptive of
the national history and the customs of the people.
Gogol followed his advice and wrote his “Evenings
at a Farm near Dikanka.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>This book is a chronicle of scenes of the author’s
childhood; and all his love and youthful
recollections of the country of the Cossacks are
poured from his heart into this book.</p>

<p>A certain old man, whose occupation is that of
raising bees, is the story-teller of the party. He
relates tales of Little Russia, so that we see it
under every aspect; and gives glimpses of scenery,
rustic habits and customs, the familiar dialogues
of the people, and all sorts of legends, both terrible
and grotesque. The gay and the supernatural
are strangely blended in these recitals, but the
gay element predominates; for Gogol’s smile has
as yet no bitterness in it. His laugh is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
hearty, frank laugh of the young Cossack who
enjoys life. All this is related in racy, expressive
language, full of words peculiar to Little Russia,
curious local expressions, and those affectionate
diminutives quite impossible to translate or express
in a more formal language. Sometimes the
author bursts forth in a poetical vein, when certain
impressions or scenes of his native country
float before his eyes. At the beginning of his
“Night in May” is this paragraph:—“Do you
know the beauty of the nights of Ukraine? The
moon looks down from the deep, immeasurable
vault, which is filled to overflowing and palpitating
with its pure radiance. The earth is silver;
the air is deliciously cool, yet almost oppressive
with perfume. Divine, enchanting night! The
great forest trees, black, solemn, and still, reposing
as if oppressed with thought, throw out their
gigantic shadows. How silent are the ponds!
Their dark waters are imprisoned within the vine-laden
walls of the gardens. The little virgin forest
of wild cherry and young plum-trees dip their
dainty roots timidly into the cold waters; their
murmuring leaves angrily shiver when a little current
of the night wind stealthily creeps in to caress
them. The distant horizon sleeps, but above it and
overhead all is palpitating life; august, triumphal,
sublime! Like the firmament, the soul seems to
open into endless space; silvery visions of grace
and beauty arise before it. Oh! the charm of
this divine night!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
“Suddenly life, animation, spreads through forest,
lake, and steppe. The nightingale’s majestic
trill resounds through the air; the moon seems to
stop, embosomed in clouds, to listen. The little
village on the hill is wrapt in an enchanted slumber;
its cluster of white cottages gleam vividly in
the moonlight, and the outlines of their low walls
are sharply clear-cut against the dark shadows.
All songs are hushed; silence reigns in the homes
of these simple peasants. But here and there a
twinkling light appears in a little window of some
cottage, where supper has waited for a belated
occupant.”</p>

<p>Then, from a scene like this, we are called
to listen to a dispute and quarrel between two
soldiers, which ends in a dance. Now the scene
changes again. The lady of the lake, the Fate
lady, rises from her watery couch, and by her
sorceries unravels the web of fortune. Again,
between the uproarious bursts of laughter, the
old story-teller heaves a melancholy sigh, and
relates a bit of pathos,—for a vein of sadness is
always latent in the gay songs and legends of this
people. These sharp contrasts fill this work with
life and color. The book excited considerable attention,
and was the more welcome as it revealed a
corner of Russia then hardly known. Gogol had
struck the right chord. Pushkin, who especially
enjoyed humor, lauded the work to the skies;
and it is still highly appreciated by Russians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
As for us, while we recognize its high qualities,
the work does not wholly please us. Perhaps we
are too old or morose to appreciate and enjoy
these rustic jokes, and the comic scenes are perhaps
a little coarse for our liking. It may be,
too, that the enthusiastic readers of 1832 looked
upon life with different eyes from ours; and that
it is only the difference in time that biases our
opinion. To them this book was wonderfully in
advance of its time; to us it seems perhaps
somewhat behind. Nothing is more difficult than
to estimate what effect a work which is already
old (especially if it be written in a foreign language)
will produce <a id="chg0"></a>on our readers of to-day. Are
we amused by the legend of “La Dame Blanche”?
Certainly we are, for everybody enjoys it. Then
perhaps the “Ladies of the Lake” of Gogol’s
book will be amusing.</p>

<p>In 1834 Gogol published his “Evenings near
Mirgorod,” including a veritable ghost story, terror-inspiring
enough to make the flesh creep.</p>

<p>The principal work of this period of the author’s
career, however, and the one which established
his fame, was “Taras Bulba,” a prose epic,
a poetical description of Cossack life as it was in
his grandfather’s time. Not every writer of modern
epics has been so fortunate as Gogol; to live
at a time when he could apply Homer’s method to
a subject made to his hand; only repeating, as he
himself said, the narratives of his grandfather, an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
actual witness and actor in this Iliad. It was
scarcely more than half a century since the breaking-up
of the Zaporovian camps of the corsairs and
the last Polish war, in which Cossack and Pole
vied with each other in ferocious deeds of valor,
license, and adventure. This war forms the subject
of the principal scenes of this drama, which
also gives a vivid picture of the daily life of the
savage republic of the Zaporovian Cossacks. The
work is full of picturesque descriptions, and possesses
every quality belonging to an epic poem.</p>

<p>M. Viardot has given us an honest version of
“Taras Bulba,” giving more actual information
about this republic of the Dnieper than any of
the erudite dissertations on the subject. But what
is absolutely impossible to render in a translation
is the marvellous beauty of Gogol’s poetic prose.
The Russian language is undoubtedly the richest
of all the European languages. It is so very clear
and concise that a single word is often sufficient
to express several different connected ideas, which,
in any other language, would require several
phrases. Therefore I will refrain from giving any
quotations of these classic pages, which are taught
in all the Russian schools.</p>

<p>The poem is very unequal in some respects.
The love passages are inferior and commonplace,
and the scenes of passion decidedly hackneyed in
style and expression. In regard to epic poems,
the truth is that the mould is worn out; it has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
been used too long; although Guizot, one of the
best judges of this sort of composition, said that
in his opinion “Taras Bulba” was the only modern
epic poem worthy of the name.</p>

<p>Even the descriptions of scenery in “Taras”
do not seem to us wholly natural. We must
compare them with those of Turgenef to realize
how comparatively inferior they are. Both were
students and lovers of nature: but the one artist
placed his model before his easel in whatever
attitude he chose; while to the other she was a
despotic mistress, whose every fancy he humbly
obeyed. This can be readily understood by a
comparison of some of their works. Although I
am not fond of epics, I have called particular attention
to “Taras Bulba,” knowing what pride the
Russians take in the work.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>In 1835, Nikolai Vasilievitch (Gogol) gave up
his position in the University, and left the public
service for good. “Now I am again a free Cossack!”
he wrote at this time, which was the time
of his greatest literary activity.</p>

<p>His novels now show him groping after realism,
rather than indulging his fancy. Among the unequal
productions of the transition period, “Le
Manteau” is the most notable one. A late Russian
politician and author once said to me: “Nous
sommes tous sortis du manteau de Gogol.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
“Le Manteau” (as well as the “Revizor,” “Inspector-General”)
was the outgrowth of his one
year’s experience in the government offices; and
the fulfilment of a desire to avenge his life of
a galley slave while there. These works were
his first blows aimed at the administrative power.
Gogol had always had a desire to write for the
stage; and produced several satirical comedies;
but none of them, except the “Revizor,” had any
success. The plot of the piece is quite simple.
The functionaries of a provincial government
office are expecting the arrival of an inspector,
who was supposed to come incognito to examine
their books and accounts. A traveller chances to
alight at the inn, whom they all suppose to be
the dreaded officer of justice. Their guilty consciences
make them terribly anxious. Each one
attacks the supposed judge, to plead his own
cause, and denounce a colleague, slipping into
the man’s hand a generous supply of propitiatory
roubles. Amazed at first, the stranger is, however,
astute enough to accept the situation and
pocket the money. The confusion increases,
until comes the crash of the final thunderbolt,
when the real commissioner arrives upon the
scene.</p>

<p>The intention of the piece is clearly marked.
The venality and arbitrariness of the administration
are exposed to view. Gogol says, in his
“Confessions of an Author”: “In the ‘Revizor,’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
I tried to present in a mass the results arising from
the one crying evil of Russia, as I recognized it
in that year; to expose every crime that is committed
in those offices, where the strictest uprightness
should be required and expected. I meant
to satirize the great evil. The effect produced
upon the public was a sort of terror; for they felt
the force of my true sentiments, my real sadness
and disgust, through the gay satire.”</p>

<p>In fact, the disagreeable effect predominated
over the fun, especially in the opinion of a foreigner;
for there is nothing of the French lightness
and elegance of diction in the Russian style.
I mean that quality which redeems Molière’s
“Tartuffe” from being the blackest and most
terrible of dramas.</p>

<p>When we study the Russian drama, we can see
why this form of art is more backward in that
country than in any other. Poetry and romance
have made more rapid strides, because they are
taken up only by the cultivated class. There is
virtually no middle class; and theatrical literature,
the only diversion for the people, has
remained in its infancy.</p>

<p>There is an element of coarseness in the drollery
of even the two masterpieces: the comedy
by Griboyedof, “Le Mal de Trop d’Esprit,”
and the “Revizor” by Gogol. In their satire
there is no medium between broad fun and
bitterness. The subtle wit of the French author
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
ridicules without wounding; his keen witticism
calls forth laughter; while the sharp,
cutting satire of the Russian produces bitter
reflection and regret. His drollery is purely
national, and is exercised more upon external
things and local peculiarities; while Molière rails
at and satirizes humanity and its ways and weaknesses.
I have often seen the “Revizor” performed.
The amiable audience laugh immoderately
at what a foreigner cannot find amusing, and
which would be utterly incomprehensible to one
not well acquainted with Russian life and customs.
On the contrary, a stranger recognizes much
more keenly than a Russian the undercurrent of
pathos and censure. Administrative reform is
yet too new in Russia for the public to be as
much shocked as one would expect at the spectacle
of a venal administration. The evil is so
very old!</p>

<p>Whoever is well acquainted with the Oriental
character knows that their ideas of morality are
broader, or, rather, more lax, than ours, because
their ideas of the rights of the government are different.
The root of these notions may be traced
to the ancient principle of tribute money; the old
claim of the powerful over the weak, whom they
protect and patronize.</p>

<p>What strikes us as the most astonishing thing
in regard to this comedy is that it has been
tolerated at all. We cannot understand, from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
what we know of the Emperor Nicholas, how he
could have enjoyed such an audacious satire upon
his government; but we learn that he himself
laughed heartily, giving the signal for applause
from his royal box. His relations with Gogol are
very significant, showing the helplessness of the
absolute power against the consequences of its own
existence. No monarch ever did more to encourage
talent, or in a more delicate way. Some one
called his attention to the young author’s poverty.</p>

<p>“Has he talent?” asked the Czar. Being
assured that he had, the Emperor immediately
placed the sum of 5000 roubles<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> at his disposition,
saying, with the greatest delicacy: “Do not let
your protégé know that the gift comes from me;
he would be less independent in the exercise of
his talents.” The Emperor continued therefore
in future to supply him incognito, through the
poet Zhukovski. Thanks to the imperial munificence,
this incorrigible traveller could expatriate
himself to his heart’s content, and get rest and
refreshment for future labors.</p>

<p>The year 1836 was a critical one for Gogol.
He became ill in body and mind, and the melancholy
side of his nature took the ascendency.
Although his comedy had been a great success at
St. Petersburg and at court, such a work could
not but excite rancor and raise up enemies for
its author. He became morbidly sensitive, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
considered himself the object of persecution. A
nervous disease, complicated with hypochondria,
began to undermine his constitution. A migratory
instinct, which always possessed him in any crisis
of his life, now made him resolve to travel; “to
fly,” as he said. But he never returned to his
country for any length of time, and only at long
intervals; declaring, as Turgenef did some years
later, that his own country, the object of his
studies, was best seen from afar.</p>

<p>After travelling extensively, Gogol finally settled
at Rome, where he formed a strong friendship
with the painter Ivanof, who for twenty years
had been in retirement in a Capuchin monastery,
working upon his picture, which he never finished,
“The Birth of Christ.” The two friends became
deeply imbued with an ascetic piety; and from
this time dates the mysticism attributed to Gogol.
But before his mind became obscured he collected
his forces for his last and greatest effort. He carried
away with him from Russia the conception of
this work, which excluded all other thoughts from
his mind. It ruled his whole existence, as Goethe
was for thirty years ruled by his “Faust.”</p>

<p>Gogol gave Pushkin the credit of having suggested
the work to him, which never was finished,
but which he wrestled with until he finally succumbed,
vanquished by it. Pushkin had spoken
to him of his physical condition, fearing a premature
death; and urged him to undertake a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
work, quoting the example of Cervantes, whose
works previous to “Don Quixote” would never
have classed him among the great authors. He
suggested a subject, which he said he never should
have given to any other person. It was the subject
of “Dead Souls.” In spite of the statement,
I cannot help feeling that “Dead Souls” was inspired
by Cervantes; for, on leaving Russia, Gogol
had gone at once to Spain, where he studied the
literature of that country diligently; especially
“Don Quixote,” which had always been his favorite
book. It furnished a theme just suited to his
plan; the adventures of a hero impelled to penetrate
into every strange region and into every
stratum of society; an ingenious excuse for presenting
to the world in a series of pictures the
magic lantern of humanity. Both works proceed
from a satirical and meditative mind, the sadness
of which is veiled under a smile, and both belong
to a style unique in itself, entirely original. Gogol
objected to his work being called a romance. He
called it a poem, and divided it into songs instead
of chapters. Whatever title may be bestowed
upon Cervantes’ masterpiece may just as appropriately
be applied to “Dead Souls.”</p>

<p>His “poem” was to be in three parts. The first
part appeared in 1842; the second, unfinished and
rudimentary, was burned by the author in a
frenzy of despair; but after his death it was
printed from a copy which escaped destruction.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
As to the third, it is perhaps interred with his
bones, which repose in the cemetery at Moscow
under the block of marble which bears his name.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>It is well known that the Russian peasants or
serfs, “Souls” as they were popularly called,
were personal property, and to be traded with in
exactly the same way as any other kind of property.
A proprietor’s fortune was reckoned according
to the number of male serfs he owned. If any
man owned, for instance, a thousand of them, he
could sell or exchange them, or obtain loans upon
them from the banks. The owner was, besides,
obliged to pay taxes upon them at so much a head.
The census was taken only at long intervals, during
which the lists were never examined. The
natural changes of population and increase by
births being supposed to make up for the deaths.
If a village was depopulated by an epidemic,
the ruling lord and master sustained the loss,
continuing to pay taxes for those whose work was
done forever.</p>

<p>Tchitchikof, the hero of the book, an ambitious
and evil-minded rascal, made this proposition to
himself: “I will visit the most remote corners of
Russia, and ask the good people to deduct from
the number on their lists every serf who has
died since the last census was taken. They will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
be only too glad, as it will be for their interest to
yield up to me a fictitious property, and get rid
of paying the tax upon it. I shall have my purchases
registered in due form, and no tribunal
will imagine that I require it to legalize a sale of
dead men. When I have obtained the names of
some thousands of serfs, I shall carry my deeds to
some bank in St. Petersburg or Moscow, and
raise a large sum on them. Then I shall be a
rich man, and in condition to buy real peasants in
flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>This proceeding offers great advantages to the
author in attaining his ends. He enters, with
his hero, all sorts of homes, and studies social
groups of all classes. The demand the hero
makes is one calculated to exhibit the intelligence
and peculiar characteristics of each proprietor.
The trader enters a house and makes the
strange proposition: “Give me up the number
of your dead serfs,” without explaining, of course,
his secret motives. After the first shock of surprise,
the man comprehends more or less quickly
what is wanted of him, and acts from instinct,
according to his nature. The simple-minded give
willingly gratis what is asked of them; the distrustful
are on their guard, and try to penetrate
the mystery, and gain something for themselves
by the arrangement; the avaricious exact an exorbitant
price. Tchitchikof finds some wretches
more evil than himself. The only case which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
never occurs is an indignant refusal, or a denunciation;
the financier well knew how few scruples
he should have to contend with in his fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>The enterprise supplied Gogol with an inexhaustible
source of both comic and touching incidents
and situations. The skilful author, while
he apparently ignores, under an assumption of
pleasantry, the lugubrious element in what he
describes, makes it the real background of the
whole narrative, so that it reacts terribly upon
the reader.</p>

<p>The first readers of this work, and possibly
even the author himself, hardly appreciated the
force of these contrasts; because they were so
accustomed to the horrors of serfdom that an
abuse of this nature seemed to them a natural
proceeding. But with time the effect of the book
increases; and the atrocious mockery of using
the dead as articles of merchandise, which seems to
prolong the terrors of slavery, from which death
has freed them, strikes the reader with horror.</p>

<p>The types of character created by Gogol in this
work are innumerable; but that of the hero is
the most curious of all, and was the outgrowth of
laborious study. Tchitchikof is not a Robert
Macaire, but rather a serious Gil Blas, without his
genius. The poor devil was born under an unlucky
star. He was so essentially bad that he
carried on his enterprise without seeming to realize
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the enormous immorality of it. In fact, he
was wronging no one, in his own opinion.</p>

<p>Gogol makes an effort to broaden this type of
character, and include in it a greater number of
individuals; and we can see thereby the author’s
intention, which is to show us a type, a collective
image of Russia herself, irresponsible for her
degradation, corrupted by her own social condition.</p>

<p>This is the real, underlying theory of “Dead
Souls,” and of the “Revizor,” as well as of Turgenef’s
“Annals of a Sportsman.” In all the
moralists of this time we recognize the fundamental
sophistry of Rousseau, who poisoned the
reasoning faculties of all Europe.</p>

<p>At the end of the first part the author attempts
a half-ironical, half-serious defence of Tchitchikof.
After giving an account of his origin, he says:
“The wise man must tolerate every type of character;
he must examine all with attention, and
resolve them into their original elements….
The passions of man are as numberless as the
sands upon the sea-shore, and have no points of
resemblance; noble or base, all obey man in the
beginning, and end by obtaining terrible power
over him…. They are born with him, and he
is powerless to resist them. Whether sombre or
brilliant, they will fulfil their entire career.”…</p>

<p>From this analysis, this argument of psychological
positivism, the writer, in a roundabout
way, goes back ingeniously to the designs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Providence, which has ordered all for the best,
and will show the right path out of this chaos.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>What is after all most remarkable about the
book is that it is the reservoir of all contemporary
literature, the source of all future inventions.</p>

<p>The realism, which is only instinctive in
Gogol’s preceding works, is the main doctrine
in “Dead Souls”; and of this he is fully conscious.
The author thus apologizes for bringing
the lower classes so constantly before the <span class="lock">reader:—</span></p>

<p>“Thankless is the task of the writer who dares
reproduce what is constantly passing before the
eyes of all, unnoticed by our distracted gaze: all
the disgusting little annoyances and trials of our
every-day lives; the ordinary, indifferent characters
we must constantly meet and put up with.
How they hinder and weary us! Such a writer
will not have the applause of the masses; contemporary
critics will consider his creations
both low and useless, and will assign him an
inferior place among those writers who scoff at
humanity. He will be declared wanting in
heart, soul, and talent. For his critic will not
admit those instruments to be equally marvellous,
one of which reveals the sun and the other
the motions of invisible animalculæ; neither will
he admit what depth of thought is required to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
make a masterpiece of a picture, the subject of
which is drawn from the darker side of human
life.”….</p>

<p>Again, in one of his letters, he <span class="lock">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Those who have analyzed my powers as a
writer have not discerned the important element
of my nature, or my peculiar bent. Pushkin
alone perceived it. He always said that I was
especially endowed to bring into relief the trivialities
of life, to analyze an ordinary character, to
bring to light the little peculiarities which escape
general observation. This is, I think, my strong
point. The reader resents the baseness of my
heroes; after reading the book he returns joyfully
to the light of day. I should have been
pardoned had I only created picturesque villains;
their baseness is what will never be pardoned.
A Russian shrinks before the picture of
his nothingness.”</p>

<p>We shall see that the largest portion of the
later Russian novels were all generated by the
spirit of this initiative book, which gives to
the Slav literature its peculiar physiognomy, as
well as its high moral worth. We find in many
a passage in “Dead Souls,” breathing through
the mask of raillery and sarcasm, that heavenly
sentiment of fraternity, that love for the despised
and pity for the suffering, which animate all
Dostoyevski’s writing. In another letter he
<span class="lock">says:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
“Pity for a fallen human creature is a strong
Russian trait. There is no spectacle more touching
than our people offer when they go to assist
and cheer on their way those who are condemned
to exile in Siberia. Every one brings what he
can; provisions, money, perhaps only a few consoling
words. They feel no irritation against the
criminal; neither do they indulge in any exaggerated
sentiment which would make a hero of him.
They do not request his autograph or his likeness;
neither do they go to stare at him out of curiosity,
as often happens in more civilized parts of
Europe. There is here something more; it is not
that they wish to make excuses for the criminal,
or wrest him from the hands of justice; but they
would comfort him in his fallen condition; console
him as a brother, as Christ has told us we
should console each other.”</p>

<p>In “Dead Souls,” the true sentiment is always
masked, which makes it the more telling; but
when the first part appeared, in 1842, it was
received by some with stupefaction, by others
with indignation. Were their countrymen a set
of rascals, idiots, and poor wretches, without a
single redeeming quality? Gogol wrote: “When
I read the first chapters of my book to Pushkin,
he was prepared to laugh, as usual whenever he
heard anything of mine. But his brow soon
clouded, and his face gradually grew serious.
When I had finished, he cried, with a choking
voice: ‘Oh, God! poor Russia!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Many accused the writer of having judged his
fellow-countrymen from a sick man’s point of
view; and considered him a traducer of mankind.
They reminded him that, in spite of the
evils of serfdom and the corruption of the administration,
there were still plenty of noble hearts
and honest people in the empire of Nicholas.
The unfortunate author found that he had
written too strongly. He must now make explanations,
publish public letters and prefaces
imploring his readers to suspend their judgment
until he produced the second part of the poem,
which would counteract the darkness of the first.
But such was not the case. No bright visions
proceeded from the saddened brain of the caricaturist.</p>

<p>However, every one read the work; and its
effect has never ceased increasing as a personification
of the Russia of former times. It has
for forty years been the foundation of the wit of
the entire nation. Every joke has passed into a
proverb, and the sayings of its characters have
become household words. The foreigner who
has not read “Dead Souls” is often puzzled in
the course of conversation, for he is ignorant of
the family traditions and the ideal ancestors they
are continually referring to. Tchitchikof, his
coachman Seliphan, and their three horses are,
to a Russian, as familiar friends as Don Quixote,
Sancho, and Rosinante can be to a Spaniard.</p>

<p>Gogol returned from Rome in 1846. His
health rapidly declined, and attacks of fever
made any brain-work difficult for him. However,
he went on with his work; but his pen
betrayed the condition of his nerves. In a crisis
of the disease he burned all his books as well as
the manuscript of the second part of the poem.
He now became absorbed in religious meditations;
and, desiring to make a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, he published his last work, “Letters
to my Friends,” in order to raise the necessary
funds, and to “entreat their prayers for him,” as
he said in his preface. These letters were written
in a religious vein, but intermingled with
literary arguments; and not one of his satirical
works raised up for him so many enemies and
such abuse as this religious treatise. It is difficult
to account for the intense excitement it
produced, and the lengthy arguments it called
forth. The second half of the reign of Nicholas
is a period but little understood. In the march
of ideas of that time, there were already indications
of the coming revolutionary movement
among the young men, which was entirely
opposed to the doctrines brought forward by
Gogol. These contained a good deal of philosophy,
as well as ancient truths, mingled with some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
new ideas, which are exactly those of the present
day. But these, because they were new, were
just what met with the strongest opposition; and
he was now accused of taking upon himself the
direction of consciences, and of arrogating to himself
the right to do so by dint of his intellectual
superiority. His letters present a curious combination
of Christian humility and literary pride.
He was declared to have fallen into mysticism;
but any one who now reads his letters carefully
cannot call him a mystic. The fact that he gave
up writing to recover his health would only be
considered at any other epoch reasonable and
natural. Tolstoï, who has acted in a similar
manner, protests against this epithet being applied
to him. He, however, proposes to us a new
theology, while Gogol clung to the established
dogmas. Possibly what would have been called
“mysticism” in 1840 would not have been looked
upon as such two centuries earlier, any more than
it is a half-century later.</p>

<p>But what became of the poor author in the
midst of the tempest he himself had raised? He
went to Jerusalem and wandered for a time
among its ancient ruins; hardly a wholesome
sphere for a sick and morbid soul. Returning
to Moscow, he was made welcome in the homes
of friends. But the Cossack nature could not
rest in any fixed spot. He had no money, for he
had given everything he had to the poor. Since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
1844 the whole receipts from his works he gave
to poor students. He brought with him only a
small valise, which was crammed with newspaper
articles, criticisms, and pamphlets written against
him. This was all he possessed.</p>

<p>A person who lived in a house which he often
visited thus described him: “He was short, but
the upper part of his body was too long; he
walked with an uneven gait, was awkward and
ungainly; his hair fell over his forehead in thick
locks, and his nose was long and prominent. He
conversed but little, and not readily. Occasionally
a touch of his old gayety returned, especially
when with children, whom he passionately loved.
But he soon fell back into his hypochondria.”
This description agrees with what Turgenef
wrote of him, after his first visit to him. “There
was a slight gleam of satire in his heavy eyes,
which were small and dark. His expression was
somewhat like that of a fox. In his general
appearance there was something of the provincial
schoolmaster.” Gogol had always been awkward
and plain, which naturally produced in him a
habitual timidity. This is perhaps why, according
to his biographers, no woman ever crossed his path.
We can therefore understand why he so rarely
wrote of women.</p>

<p>It is almost universally believed that he died
from the effects of his excessive fastings and
mortification of the flesh; but I have learned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
from reliable sources that an aggravation of his
disease, with typhoid symptoms, caused his death.
But little is known of his latter years. He aged
rapidly, as Russians do, and ended his work at the
time of life when others begin theirs. A mysterious
fatality has attended nearly all the writers
of his time, who have all died at about the
age of forty. The children of Russia develop
as her vegetation does. It grows quickly and
matures young, but its magnificent growth is
soon cut off, benumbed while still in perfection.
At the age of thirty-three, after the publication
of “Dead Souls,” the productive brain-power of
Nikolai Vasilievitch was wellnigh ruined. At
forty-three he died, on the 21st of February, 1852.
The event of his death made but little sensation.
The imperial favor had quite forgotten this
writer. Even the governor of Moscow was criticized
for putting on the regalia of his order to
attend the funeral. Turgenef was exiled to his
own distant estates as a punishment for having
written a letter in which he called the deceased
author “a great man.” Posterity, however, has
ratified this title. Gogol may now be ranked,
according to some critics, with the best English
humorists; but I should place him rather between
Cervantes and Le Sage. Perhaps it may
be too soon to judge him. Should we appreciate
“Don Quixote” now if Spanish literature had not
been known for three hundred years? When we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
were children we laughed whenever an <dfn>alguazil</dfn> or
an <dfn>alcalde</dfn> was mentioned.</p>

<p>Gogol introduces us to an untried world. I
must warn the reader that he will at first find
difficulties—the strangest customs; an array of
characters not in any way connected; names as
strange as the people who bear them. He must
not expect the attractive style or class of subjects
of Tolstoï and Dostoyevski. <em>They</em> show us results,
not principles; they tell of what we can
better apprehend; for what they have studied is
more common to all Europe. Gogol wrote of
more remote times, and, besides, he and his work
are thoroughly and exclusively Russian. To be
appreciated by men of letters, then, his works
must be admirably translated; which, unfortunately,
has never yet been done. We must leave
him, therefore, in Russia, where all the new authors
of any distinction recognize in him their father
and master. They owe to him their very language.
Although Turgenef’s is more subtile and harmonious,
its originator has more life, variety, and
energy.</p>

<p>One of the last sentences that fell from his pen,
in his “Confessions of an Author,” was <span class="lock">this:—</span></p>

<p>“I have studied life as it really is—not in
dreams of the imagination; and thus have I come
to a conception of Him who is the source of all
life.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the name of Gogol was temporarily lost
in oblivion during the years preceding the Crimean
war, his spirit was shedding its ripening influences
upon the thinking minds of his country. I know
of no parallel example in the history of literature,
of an impulse so spontaneous and vigorous as
this. Every author of note since 1840 has belonged
to the so-called “school of nature.” The
poets of 1820 had drawn their inspiration from
their own personality. The novel-writers of 1840
found theirs in the spirit of humanity, which
might be called social sympathy.</p>

<p>Before studying the great writers of this epoch,
we must take note of the elements which produced
them, and glance for a moment at the
curious movement which ripened them.</p>

<p>Russia could not escape the general fermentation
of 1848; although this immense country
seemed to be mute, like its frozen rivers, an intense
life was seething underneath. The rivers are
seemingly motionless for six months of the year;
but under the solid ice is running water, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
phenomena of ever-increasing life. So it was
with the nation. On the surface it seemed silent
and inert under the iron rule of Nicholas. But
European ideas, creeping in, found their way
under the great walls, and books passed from
hand to hand, into schools, literary circles, and
even into the army.</p>

<p>The Russian Universities were then very insufficient.
Their best scholars quitted them unsatisfied,
and sought more substantial nourishment in
Germany. Besides, it being the fashion to do so,
there was also a firm conviction that this was
really necessary. The young men returned from
Berlin or Göttingen crammed with humanitarian
philosophy and liberal notions; armed with ideas
which found no response in their own country, full,
as it was, of malcontents and fault-finders. These
suspicious missionaries from western Europe were
handed over to the police, while others continued
to study in the self-same school. These young
fellows, returning from Germany with grapes
from the promised land, too green as yet for their
countrymen, formed a favorite type with authors.
Pushkin made use of it, and Turgenef afterwards
gave us some sketches from nature made during
his stay in Berlin. On their return, these students
formed clubs, in which they discussed the foreign
theories in low and impassioned voices, and initiated
their companions who had remained at
home. These young thinkers embraced a transcendental
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
philosophy, borrowed from Hegel, Stein,
and Feuerbach, as well as from Saint-Simon,
Fourier and Proudhon in France. These metaphysics,
of course, were a mask which covered
more concrete objects and more immediate interests.
Two great intellectual schools divided
Russia, and took the place of political parties.</p>

<p>The <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> party adhered to the views of
Karamzin and protested against the unpatriotic
blasphemies of Tchadayef. For this party nothing
whatever existed outside of Russia, which was to
be considered the only depository of the true
Christian spirit, and chosen to regenerate the
world.</p>

<p>In opposition to these Levites, the liberal school
of the West had appeared; a camp of Gentiles,
which breathed only of reforms, audacious arguments,
and coming revolutions; liberalism developing
into radicalism. But, as all social and
political discussions were prohibited in Russia,
these must be concealed under the disguise of
philosophy, and be expressed in its hieroglyphics.
The metaphysical subtleties in these literary
debates did little to clear up the obscurity of the
ideas themselves, which are very difficult to
unravel and comprehend. In attempting to
understand the controversies in Russia at this
time, you feel as if watching the movements of a
complicated figure in the ballet; where indistinct
forms are seen moving behind a veil of black
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
gauze, intended to represent clouds, which half
conceal the dancers.</p>

<p>The liberals of 1848 carried on the ideas of the
revolutionaries of December, 1825; as the Jacobins
developed those of the Girondists. But the difference
between the ideals of the two generations is
very marked, showing the march of time and of
ideas. The revolutionists of 1825 were aristocrats,
who coveted the elegant playthings fashionable
in London and Paris—a charter and a Parliament.
They were ambitious to place their
enormous, unwieldy country under a new and
fragile government. They played the conspirator
like children, but their game ended tragically;
for they were all exiled to Siberia or elsewhere.</p>

<p>When this spirit awoke twenty years after, it
had dreamed new dreams. This time it aimed at
the entire remodelling of our poor old world.
The Russians now embraced the socialist and
democratic ideas of Europe; but, in accepting
these international theories, they did not see how
inapplicable they were to Russia at this time.
Penetrated as they were with the rationalistic
and irreligious spirit of the eighteenth century,
they have nothing in common with the grave
sympathy of such men as Dostoyevski and
Tolstoï. These are realists that love humanity;
but the others were merely metaphysicians, whose
love for humanity has changed into hatred of
society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Every young writer of the “school of nature”
produced his socialistic romance, bitterly satirical,
and showing the influence of George Sand and
Eugène Sue. But an unsuccessful conspiracy
headed by Petrachevski put an end temporarily
to this effervescence of ideas. Russia became
calm again, while every sign of intellectual life
was pitilessly repressed, not to stir again until
after the death of the Emperor Nicholas. The
most violent of the revolutionists had secured
their property in foreign lands; and all authors
were either condemned or exiled. Many of them
followed Petrachevski to Siberia. Turgenef was
among the most fortunate, having been exiled to
his own estates in the country. The <dfn>Slavophile</dfn>
party itself did not wholly escape punishment and
exile. Even the long beards, which formed a part
of their patriotic programme, had no better fate
than their writings. All were forbidden to wear
them. The government now suppressed all the
scientific missions and pilgrimages to the German
Universities, which had produced such bad results.
While Peter the Great drove his subjects out
of the Empire to breathe the air of Europe,
Nicholas forced his to remain within it. Passports
could only be obtained with great difficulty,
and at the exorbitant price of 500 roubles. In
every University and seminary of learning in
the Empire, the teaching of philosophy was forbidden,
as well as the classics; and all historical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
publications were subject to a severe control,
which was almost equivalent to a prohibition.
There were now but seven small newspapers
printed in all Russia, and these were filled with
the most insignificant facts. The wars in Hungary
and in the East were hardly alluded to. The
first article of any consequence appeared in 1857.
The absurd severity exercised towards the press
furnished material for a long and amusing article
in the leading journal. The word <dfn>liberty</dfn> was
underscored wherever and in whatever sense it
occurred, as the word <dfn>King</dfn> was, during the
reign of Terror in France.</p>

<p>These years of “terror” have since furnished
much amusement for the Russians; but those
who passed through them, warmed by the enthusiasm
and illusions of youth, have always retained,
together with the disinclination to express
themselves frankly, a vein of pathos throughout
their writings. Besides, the liberty granted to
authors in the reign of Alexander <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was only
a relative one; which explains why they returned
instinctively to novel-writing as the only mode
of expression which permitted any undercurrent of
meaning. In this agreeable form we must seek for
the ideas of that time on philosophy, history, and
politics; for which reason I have dwelt on the
importance of studying the Russian novelists
attentively. In their romances, and only in
them, shall we find a true history of the last
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
half-century of their country, and form a just
idea of the public for which the works were
written.</p>

<p>This people’s way of reasoning and their demands
are peculiar to themselves. In France,
we expect of a romance what we expect of any
work of art, according to the degree of civilization
we have reached; something to afford us a refined
amusement; a diversion from the serious
interests of life; merely a passing impression.
We read books as a passing pedestrian looks
at a picture displayed in some shop window,
casually, on his way to his business. They regard
the masters of their language quite otherwise
in Russia. What for us is a temporary
gratification is to them the soul’s daily bread;
for they are passing through the golden age of
their literature. Their authors are the guides of
the race, almost the creators of their language;
their poets are such according to the ancient
and full sense of the word—<dfn>vates</dfn>, poet, prophet.</p>

<p>In Russia, the small educated class have perhaps
surpassed us in cultivation; but the lower
classes are just beginning to read with eagerness,
faith, and hope; as we read Robinson Crusoe at
twelve years of age. Their sensitive imaginations
are alive to the full effect these works are calculated
to produce. Journalism has not scattered
their ideas and lessened their power of attention.
They draw no comparisons, and therefore believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
<em>We</em> consider “Fathers and Sons,” and “War
and Peace” merely novels. But to the merchant
of Moscow, the son of the village priest, the
country proprietor, either of these works is almost
like a national Bible, which he places upon the
shelf holding the few books which represent to
him an encyclopædia of the human mind. They
have the importance and signification for him
that the story of Esther had for the Jews, and the
adventures of Ulysses for the Athenians.</p>

<p>Our readers will pardon these general considerations,
which seemed to us necessary before
approaching the three most prominent figures of
this period, which we choose from among many
others as the most original of the two groups
they divide into. Dostoyevski will represent to
us the opinions of the <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> or national
school; Turgenef will show us how many can
remain thoroughly Russian without breaking off
their connections with the rest of Europe; and
how there can be realists with a feeling for art
and a longing to attain a lofty ideal. He belonged
to the liberal party, which claims him as its
own; but this great artist, gradually freeing himself
from all bounds, soars far above the petty
bickerings of party strife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Turgenef’s talent, in the best of his productions,
draws its inspiration directly from his beloved
father-land. We feel this in every page we read.
This is probably why his contemporaries long preferred
him to any of his rivals. In letters, as
well as in politics, the people instinctively follow
the leaders whom they feel belong to them; and
whose spirit and qualities, even whose failings,
they share in common. Ivan Sergievitch Turgenef
possessed the dominant qualities of every
true Russian: natural kindness of heart, simplicity,
and resignation. With a remarkably powerful
brain, he had the heart of a child. I never
met him without realizing the true meaning of
the gospel words, ‘poor in spirit’; and that that
quality can be the accompaniment of a scientific
mind and the soul of an artist. Devotion, generosity,
brotherly love, were perfectly natural to
him. Into the midst of our busy and complicated
civilization he seemed to drop down as if from
some pastoral tribe of the mountains; and to
carry out his ideas under our sky as naturally as
a shepherd guides his flocks in the steppe.</p>

<p>As to his personal appearance, he was tall, with
a quiet dignity in his manner, features somewhat
coarse; and his finely formed head and searching
glance brought to mind some Russian patriarch of
the peasant class; only ennobled and transfigured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
by intellectual cultivation, like those peasants
of old who became monks and perhaps saints.
He gave me the impression of a person possessing
the native frankness of the peasant, while
endowed with the inspiration of genius; and who
had reached a high intellectual elevation without
having lost anything of his natural simplicity and
candor. Such a comparison could not, surely,
offend one who so loved his people!</p>

<p>Now, when the time has come to speak of his
work, my heart fails me, and I feel disposed to
throw down my pen. I have spoken of his
virtues; why should we say more, or dwell upon
the brilliant qualities of his mind, adding greater
eulogies? But those who know him well are few,
and they will soon die and be forgotten. We
must then try to show to others what that great
heart has left of itself in the works of his imagination.
These are not few, and show much persevering
labor. The last complete edition of his
works comprises not less than ten volumes: romances,
novels, critical and dramatic essays. The
most notable of these have been carefully translated
into French, under the direction of the
author himself; and no foreigner’s work has ever
been as much read and appreciated in Paris as his.</p>

<p>The name of Turgenef was well known, and
had acquired a literary reputation in Paris, at the
beginning of the present century; for a cousin
of the author’s, Nikolai Ivanovitch (Turgenef),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
after having distinguished himself in the government
service under Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, was implicated
in the conspiracy of December, 1825, and exiled
by the Emperor Nicholas. He spent the remainder
of his life in Paris, where he published his
important work, “Russia and the Russians.” He
was a distinguished man and an honest thinker,
if perhaps a little narrow, and one of the most
sincere of those who became liberals after 1812.
Faithful to his friends who were exiled to Siberia,
he became their advocate, and also warmly pleaded
the cause of the emancipation of the serfs; so
that his young cousin continued a family tradition
when he gave the death-blow to slavery with
his first book.</p>

<p>Turgenef was born in 1818, on the family
estate in Orel, and his early years were passed in
this solitary place, in one of those “Nests of
Nobles” which are so often the scene of his
novels. According to the fashion of that time,
he had both French and German tutors, which
were considered a necessary appendage in every
nobleman’s household. His mother-tongue was
held in disrepute; so his first Russian verses were
read in secret, with the help of an old servant.
Fortunately for him, he acquired the best part of
his education out on the heaths with the huntsmen,
whose tales were destined to become masterpieces,
transformed by the great author’s pen.
Passing his time in the woods, and running over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
the marshes in pursuit of quail, the poet laid in a
rich stock of imagery and picturesque scenes
with which he afterwards clothed his ideas. In
the imagination of some children, while thought
is still sleeping, impressions accumulate, one
by one, like the night-dew; but, in the awakening
dawn, the first ray of the morning sun will
reveal these glittering diamonds.</p>

<p>After going to school at Moscow, and through
the University at St. Petersburg, he went, as
others did, to conclude his course of study in
Germany. In 1838, he was studying the philosophy
of Kant and Hegel at Berlin. He said of
himself later in regard to this: “The impulse
which drew the young men of my time into a
foreign land reminds me of the ancient Slavs
going to seek for chiefs from beyond the seas.
Every one felt that his native country, morally
and intellectually considered, was great and rich,
but ill regulated.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> For myself, I fully realized
that there were great disadvantages in being
torn from one’s native soil, where one had been
brought up; but there was nothing else to be
done. This sort of life, especially in the sphere to
which I belonged, of landed proprietors and serfdom,
offered me nothing attractive. On the contrary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
what I saw around me was revolting—in
fact, disgusting—to me. I could not hesitate long.
I must either make up my mind to submit, and
walk on quietly in the beaten track; or tear myself
away, root and branch, even at the risk of
losing many things dear to my heart. This I
decided to do. I became a cosmopolitan, which I
have always remained. I could not live face to
face with what I abhorred; perhaps I had not sufficient
self-control or force of character for that.
At any rate, it seemed as if I must, at all hazards,
withdraw from my enemy, in order to be able to
deal him surer blows from a distance. This mortal
enemy was, in my eyes, the institution of serfdom,
which I had resolved to combat to the last
extremity, and with which I had sworn never to
make peace. It was in order to fulfil this vow
that I left my country….”</p>

<p>The writer will now become a European; he
will uphold the method of Peter the Great,
against those patriots who have entrenched themselves
behind the great Chinese wall. Reason,
good laws, and good literature have no fixed
country. Every one must seize his treasure wherever
he can find it, in the common soil of humanity,
and develop it in his own way. In reading
the strong words of his own confession we are led
to a feeling of anxiety for the poet’s future. Will
politics turn him from his true course? Fortunately
they did not. Turgenef had too literary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and contemplative a nature to throw himself into
that vortex. But he kept his vow of taking his
aim—and a terrible one it was—at the institution
of serfdom. The contest was fierce, and the
war was a holy one.</p>

<p>Returning to Russia, Turgenef published some
poems and dramatic pieces; but he afterward excluded
all these from the complete edition of his
works; and, leaving Russia again, he sent his first
prose work, “Annals of a Sportsman,” which was
to contribute greatly to his fame as a novelist, to
a St. Petersburg review. He continued to send
various little bombshells, from 1847 to 1851, in the
form of tales and sketches, hiding their meaning
under a veil of poetry. The influence of Gogol
was perceptible in his work at this time, especially
in his comprehension of nature. His scenes were
always Russian, but the artist’s interpretation was
different from Gogol’s, having none of his rough
humor and enthusiasm, but more delicacy and
ideality. His language too is richer, more flowing,
more picturesque and expressive than any Russian
author had yet attained to; and it perfectly
translates the most fugitive chords of the grand
harmonious register of nature. The author
carries us with him into the very heart of his
native country.</p>

<p>The “Annals of a Sportsman” have charmed
many French readers, much as they must lose
through the double veil of translation and our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
ignorance of the country. Indeed we must have
lived in the country described by Turgenef to fully
appreciate the way in which he presents on every
page the exact copy of one’s personal impressions;
even bringing to the senses every delicate odor
breathed from the earth. Some of his descriptions
of nature have the harmonious perfection of a
fantastic symphony written in a minor key.</p>

<p>In the “Living Relics,” he wakes a more human,
more interior chord. On a hunting expedition, he
enters by chance an abandoned shed, where he
finds a wretched human being, a woman, deformed,
and unable to move. He recognizes in her a
former serving-maid of his mother’s, once a gay,
laughing girl, now paralyzed, stricken by some
strange and terrible disease. This poor creature,
reduced to a skeleton, lying forgotten in this miserable
shed, has no longer any relations with the
outside world. No one takes care of her; kind
people sometimes replenish her jar with fresh
water. She requires nothing else. The only sign
of life, if life it can be called, is in her eyes and
her faint respiration. But this hideous wreck of
a body contains an immortal soul, purified by
suffering, utterly resigned, lifted above itself, this
simple peasant nature, into the realms of perfect
self-renunciation.</p>

<p>Lukeria relates her misfortune; how she was
seized with this illness after a fall in the dark;
how she had gone out one dark evening to listen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
to the songs of the nightingales; how gradually
every faculty and every joy of life had forsaken
her.</p>

<p>Her betrothed was so sorry; but, then, afterwards
he married; what else could he do? She
hopes he is happy. For years her only diversion
has been to listen to the church-bells and the
drowsy hum of the bees in the hives of the apiary
near by. Sometimes a swallow comes and flutters
about in the shed, which is a great event, and
gives her something to think about for several
weeks. The people that bring water to her are
so kind, she is so grateful to them! And gradually,
almost cheerfully, she goes back with the
young master to the memories of old days, and
reminds him how vain she was of being the leader
in all the songs and dances; at last, she even tries
to hum one of those songs.</p>

<p>“I really dreaded to have this half-dead creature
try to sing. Before I could speak, she uttered a
sound very faintly, but the note was correct; then
another, and she began to sing, ‘In the Fields’
… as she sang there was no change of expression
in her paralyzed face or in her fixed eyes. This
poor little forced voice sounded so pathetically,
and she made such an effort to express her whole
soul, that my heart was pierced with the deepest
pity.”</p>

<p>Lukeria relates her terrible dreams, how Death
has appeared before her; not that she dreads his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
coming, but he always goes away and refuses
to deliver her. She refuses all offers of assistance
from her young master; she desires nothing, needs
nothing, is perfectly content. As her visitor is
about to leave her, she calls him back for a last
word. She seems to be conscious (how feminine
is this!) of the terrible impression she must have
made upon him, and <span class="lock">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Do you remember, master, what beautiful hair
I had? you know it reached to my knees…. I
hesitated a long time about cutting it off; but
what could I do with it as I am? So—I cut it
off…. Adieu, master!”</p>

<p>All this cannot be analyzed any more than the
down on a butterfly’s wing; and yet it is such a
simple tale, but how suggestive! There is no
exaggeration; it is only one of the accidents of
life. The poor woman feels that if one believes in
God, there are things of more importance than
her little misfortune. The point which is most
strongly brought forward, however, in this tale,
and in nearly all the others, is the almost stoical
resignation, peculiar to the Russian peasant, who
seems prepared to endure anything. This author’s
talent lies in his keeping the exquisite balance
between the real and the ideal; every detail is
strikingly and painfully real, while the ideal shines
through and within every thought and fact. He
has given us innumerable pictures of master, overseer,
and serf; clothing every repulsive fact with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
a grace and charm, seemingly almost against his
will, but which are born of his own poetical
nature.</p>

<p>It is not wholly correct to say that Turgenef
<em>attacked</em> slavery. The Russian writers never
attack openly; they neither argue nor declaim.
They describe, drawing no conclusions; but they
appeal to our pity more than to our anger. Fifteen
years later Dostoyevski published his “Recollections
of a Dead-House.” He took the same
method—without expressing a word of indignation,
without one drop of gall; he seems to think
what he describes quite natural, only somewhat
pathetic. This is a national trait.</p>

<p>Once I stopped for one night at an inn in Orel,
our author’s native place. Early in the morning,
I was awakened by the beating of drums.
I looked down into the market-place, which
was full of soldiers drawn up in a square, and a
crowd of people stood looking on. A pillory had
been erected in the square, a large, black, wooden
pillar, with a scaffolding underneath. Three poor
fellows were tied to the pillar, and had parchments
on their backs, giving an account of their
misdeeds. These thieves seemed very docile, and
almost unconscious of what was being done to
them. They made a picturesque group, with
their handsome Slavonic heads, and bound to
this pillar. The exhibition lasted long; the
priests came to bless them; and when the cart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
came to carry them back to prison, both soldiers
and people rushed after them, loading them with
eatables, small coins, and words of sympathy.</p>

<p>The Russian writer who aims to bring about
reforms, in like manner displays his melancholy
picture, with spasms of indulgent sympathy for
the evils he unveils. The public needs but a hint.
This time it understood. Russia looked upon
serfdom in the mirror he showed her, and shuddered.
The author became celebrated, and his
cause was half gained. The censorship, always
the last to become convinced, understood too, at
last. Serfdom was already condemned in the
heart of the Emperor Nicholas, but the censorship
does not always agree with the Emperor; it
is always procrastinating; sometimes it is left far
behind, perhaps for a whole reign. It will not
condemn the book, but keeps its eye upon the
author.</p>

<p>Gogol died at this time, and Turgenef wrote a
strong article in praise of the dead author. This
article appears to-day entirely inoffensive, but
the author himself thus speaks of <span class="lock">it:—</span></p>

<p>“In regard to my article on Gogol, I remember
one day at St. Petersburg, a lady in high position
at court was criticizing the punishment inflicted
upon me, as unjust and undeserved, or, at least,
too severe. Some one replied: ‘Did you not
know that he calls Gogol “a great man” in that
article?’ ‘That is not possible.’ ‘I assure you he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
did.’ ‘Ah! in that case, I have no more to say; I
am very sorry for him, but now I understand
their severity.’”</p>

<p>This praise, justly accorded to a great author,
procured for Turgenef a month of imprisonment
and banishment to his own estates. But this
tyranny was, perhaps, a blessing in disguise.
Thirty years before, Pushkin had been torn from
the dissipations of the gay capital, where his
genius would have been lost, and was exiled to
the Orient, where it developed into a rich bloom.
If Turgenef had remained at this time in St.
Petersburg, he might have been drawn, in his
hot-headed youth, by compromising friendships,
into some fruitless political broil; but, exiled to
the solitude of his native woods, he spent several
years there in literary <a id="chg1"></a>work; studying the humble
life around him, and collecting materials for
his first great novels.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Turgenef always declared himself as no admirer
of Balzac. This was, no doubt, true; for
they had no points of resemblance in common.
Still I cannot but think that that sworn disciple
of Gogol and of the “school of nature” must have
received some suggestions from our great author.
Turgenef, like Balzac, gave us the comedy of
human life in his native country; but to this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
great work he gave more heart and faith, and less
patience, system, and method, than the French
writer. But he possessed the gift of style, and a
racy eloquence, which are wanting in Balzac.</p>

<p>If one must read Balzac in France in order to
retrace the lives of our predecessors, this is all
the more true of Turgenef in Russia.</p>

<p>This author sharply discerned the prevailing
current of ideas which were developed in that
period of transition,—the reign of Nicholas and
the first few years of the reign of Alexander <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
It required a keen vision to apprehend and
describe the shifting characters and scenes of
that period, vivid glimpses of which we obtain
from his novels written at that time.</p>

<p>His first one of this period is “Dimitri Roudine.”
The hero of the story is an eloquent
idealist, but practically inefficient in action. His
liberal ideas are intoxicating, both to himself
and others; but he succumbs to every trial of
life, through want of character. With the best
principles and no vices whatever, except, perhaps,
an excess of personal vanity, he commits deeds in
which he is his own dupe. He is at heart too
honest to profit by offered opportunities, which
would give him advantage over others; and, with
no courage either for good or evil undertakings,
he is always unsuccessful, and always in want of
money. He finally realizes his inefficiency, in old
age, and dies in extreme poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
The characters of the prosaic country life in
which the hero’s career is pictured are marvellously
well drawn. These practical people, whose
ideas are nearly on a level with the earth which
yields them their livelihood, prosper in all things.
They have comfortable incomes, good wives, and
congenial friends; while the enthusiastic idealist,
in spite of his intellectual superiority, falls even
lower. It is the triumph of prosaic fact over
idealism. In this introductory work, the author
touched keenly upon one of the greatest defects
of the Russian character, and gave a useful lesson
to his fellow-countrymen; showing them that magnificent
aspirations are not all-sufficient, but they
must be joined to practical common-sense, and
applied to self-government. “Dimitri Roudine”
is a moral and philosophical study, inciting to
thought and interesting to the thinking mind. It
was a question whether the author would be as
skilful in the region of sentiment, whether he
would succeed in moving the heart.</p>

<p>His “Nest of Nobles”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> was his response; and
it was, perhaps, his greatest work, although not
without defects. It is less interesting than the
other, as the development of the plot drags somewhat;
but when once started, and fully outlined,
it is carried out with consummate skill.</p>

<p>The “Nest of Nobles” is one of the old provincial,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
ancestral mansions in which many generations
have lived. In this house the young girl is
reared, who will serve as a prototype for the
heroine of every Russian novel. She is simple
and straightforward, not strikingly beautiful or
gifted, but very charming, and endowed with an
iron will,—a trait which the author invariably
refuses to men, but he bestows it upon every
young heroine of his imagination. This trait
carries them through every variety of experience
and the most extreme crises, according as they
are driven by fate.</p>

<p>Liza, a girl of twenty, has been thus far wholly
insensible to the attractions of a handsome government
official, whose attentions her mother has
encouraged. Finally, weary of resistance, the
young girl consents to an engagement with him,
when Lavretski, a distant relative, appears upon
the scene. He is a married man, but has long
been separated from his wife, who is wholly
unworthy of him. She is an adventuress, who
spends her time at the various Continental watering-places.
There is nothing whatever of the
hero of romance about him; he is a quiet, kind-hearted,
and unhappy being, serious-minded and
no longer young. Altogether, a man such as is
very often to be met with in real life. He and
the young heroine are drawn together by a mysterious
attraction; and, just as the man, with his
deeper experience of life, recognizes with terror
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the nature of their mutual feelings, he learns of
the death of his wife, through a newspaper article.
He is now free; and, that very evening, in
the old garden, both hearts, almost involuntarily,
interchange vows of eternal affection. The description
of this scene is beautiful, true to nature,
and exceedingly refined. The happiness of the
lovers lasts but a single hour; the news was
false, and the next day Lavretski’s wife herself
appears most unexpectedly upon the scene.</p>

<p>We can easily see what an opportunity the
author here has for the delineation of the inevitable
revulsion and tumult of feeling called forth;
but with what delicacy he leads those two purest
of souls through such peril! The sacrifice is
resolutely made by the young girl; but only after
a fearful struggle by the lover. The annoying
and hated wife disappears again, while the reader
fondly hopes the author will bring about her
speedy death. Here again those who wish only
happy <i lang="fr">dénouements</i> must close the book. Mme.
Lavretski does not die, but continues the gayest
kind of a life, while Liza, who has known of life
only the transient promise of a love, which lasted
through the starry hours of one short evening in
May, carries her wounded heart to her God, and
buries herself in a convent.</p>

<p>So far, this is a virtuous and rather old-fashioned
story, suitable for young girls. But we must read
the farther development of the tale, to see with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
what exquisite art and love for truth the novelist
has treated his subject. There is not the slightest
approach to insipid sentimentality in this sad
picture; no outbursts of passion; but, with a chaste
and gentle touch, a restrained and continually increasing
emotion is awakened, which rends the
heart. The epilogue of this book, only a few
pages in length, is, and will always be, one of the
gems of Russian literature.</p>

<p>Eight years have passed in the course of the
story; Lavretski returns one morning in spring to
the old mansion. It is now inhabited by a new
generation, for the children have become young
men and women, with new sentiments and interests.
The new-comer, hardly recognized by them,
finds them in the midst of their games. The story
opened in the same way, and we seem to have
gone back to the beginning of it. Lavretski seats
himself upon the same spot where he once pressed
for a moment in his the hand of the dear one, who
ever since that blissful hour has been counting the
beads of her rosary in a cloister.</p>

<p>The young birds of the old nest can give no
answer to the questions he longs to ask, for they
have quite forgotten the vanished one; and they
return to their game, in which they are quite
absorbed. He reflects, in his desolation, how the
self-same words describe the same scene of other
days: nature’s smile is quite the same; the same
joys are new to other children; just as, in a sonata
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
of Chopin’s, the original theme of the melody
recurs in the finale.</p>

<p>In this romance, the melancholy contrast between
the perennity of nature and the change
and decay of man through the cruel and pitiless
work of time is very strikingly portrayed. We
have become so attached to the former characters
painted by our author, that these children, in the
heyday of their lives, are almost hateful to us.</p>

<p>I am strongly tempted to quote these pages in
full, but they would lose too much in being
separated from what precedes them; and, unwillingly
leaving the subject, I can only apply to
Turgenef his own words in regard to one of his
<span class="lock">heroes:—</span></p>

<p>“He possessed the great secret of that divine
eloquence which is music; for he knew a way to
touch certain chords in the heart which would
send a vibrating thrill through all the others.”</p>

<p>The “Nest of Nobles” established the author’s
renown. Such a strange world is this that poets,
conquerors, women also, gain the hearts of men
the more effectually by making them suffer and
weep. All Russia shed tears over this book; and
the unhappy Liza became the model for all the
young girls. No romantic work since “Paul and
Virginia” had produced such an effect upon the
people. The author seems to have been haunted
by this type of woman. His Ellen in “On the
Eve” has the same indomitable will. She has a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
serious, reserved, and obstinate nature, has been
reared in solitude; and, free from all outside influences,
and scorning all obstacles, she is capable of
the most complete self-renunciation. But in this
instance the circumstances are quite different.
The beloved one is quite free, but cast out by his
family. As Liza fled to the cloister in spite of the
supplications of her friends, so Ellen joins her
lover and devotes herself to him, not suspecting
for a moment her act to be in any way a criminal
one; but it is redeemed, in any case, by her
devoted constancy through a life of many trials.
These studies of character show a keen observation
of the national temperament. The man is
irresolute, the woman decided; she it is who rules
fate, knows what she wants to do, and does it.
Everything which, with our ideas, would seem in
a young girl like boldness and immodesty, is
pictured by the artist with such simplicity and
delicacy that we are tempted to see in it only the
freedom of a courageous, undaunted spirit.
These upright and passionate natures which he
creates seem capable of anything but fear, treachery,
and deceit.</p>

<p>The poet seems to have poured the accumulated
emotion of his whole youth into the “Nest of
Nobles” as a vent to the long repressed sentiment
of his inmost heart. He now set himself to study
the social conditions of the life around him; and
in the midst of the great intellectual movement
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of 1860, on the eve of the emancipation, he wrote
“Fathers and Sons.” This book marks a date in
the history of the Russian mind. The novelist
had the rare good-fortune to recognize a new
growth of thought, and to give it a fixed form
and name, which no other had been able to do.</p>

<p>In “Fathers and Sons,” an old man of the past
generation, discussing his character of Bazarof,
asked: “What is your opinion of Bazarof?”—“What
is he?—he is a <dfn>nihilist</dfn>,” replied a
young disciple of the terrible medical student.—“What
do you say?”—“I say he is a <dfn>nihilist</dfn>!”—“Nihilist?”
repeated the old man. “Ah, yes! that
comes from the Latin word <dfn>nihil</dfn>, and our Russian
word <dfn>nitchevo</dfn>; as well as I can judge, that
must be a man who will neither acknowledge nor
admit anything.”—“Say, rather,” added another,
“who respects nothing.”—“Who considers everything
from a critical point of view,” resumed the
young man.—“That is just the same thing.”—“No,
it is not the same thing; a nihilist is a man
who bows to no authority, and will admit no principle
as an article of faith, no matter how deeply
respected that principle may be.”</p>

<p>We must go back still farther than the Latin
to find the root of the word and the philosophy
it expresses; to the old Aryan stock, of which
the Slavonic race is one of the main branches.
Nihilism is the Hindu <dfn>nirvâna</dfn>; the yielding of
the primitive man before the power of matter and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the obscurity of the moral world; and the nirvâna
necessarily engenders a furious reaction in
the conquered being, a blind effort to destroy that
universe which can crush and circumvent him.
But I have already touched upon this subject,
which is too voluminous to dwell upon here. So
Nihilism, as we understand it, is only in its embryo
state in this famous book of Turgenef’s. I would
merely call the attention of the reader to another
passage in this book which reveals a finer understanding
of the word than volumes written upon
the subject. It is in another discussion of
Bazarof’s character, this time between an intelligent
young girl and a young disciple of Bazarof,
who honestly believes himself a nihilist.
She <span class="lock">says:—</span></p>

<p>“Your Bazarof you cannot understand, neither
can he understand you.”—“How so?”—“How
can I explain it?… He is a wild animal, and we,
you and I, are tamed animals.”</p>

<p>This comparison shows clearly the shade of
difference between Russian Nihilism and the
similar mental maladies from which human nature
has suffered from time immemorial down to the
present day.</p>

<p>This hero of Turgenef’s has many traits in
common with the Indian heroes of Fenimore
Cooper, who are armed with a tomahawk, instead
of a surgeon’s knife. Bazarof’s sons seem, at first
sight, much like our revolutionists; but examine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
them more closely, and you will discover the distinction
between the wild and the tamed beast.
Our worst revolutionists are savage dogs, but the
Russian nihilist is a wolf; and we now know that
the wolf’s rage is the more dangerous of the two.</p>

<p>See how Bazarof dies! He has contracted
blood-poison by dissecting the body of a typhoid
subject. He knows that he is lost. He endures
his agony in mute, haughty, stolid silence; it is
the agony of the wild beast with a ball in his
body. The nihilist surpasses the stoic; he does
not try to complete his task before death; there
is nothing that is worth doing.</p>

<p>The novelist has exhausted his art to create
a deplorable character, which, however, is not
really odious to us, excepting as regards his inhumanity,
his scorn for everything we venerate.
These seem intolerable to us. With the tamed
animal, this would indicate perversion, disregard
of all rules; but in the wild beast it is instinct,
a resistance wholly natural. Our moral sense is
ingeniously disarmed by the author, before this
victim of fate.</p>

<p>Turgenef’s creative power and minute observation
of details in this work have never been
excelled by him at any period of his literary
career. It is very difficult, however, to quote
passages of his, because he never writes single
pages or paragraphs for their individual effect;
but every detail is of value to the <i lang="fr">ensemble</i> of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
work. I will merely quote a passing sketch of a
character, which seems to me remarkably true to
life; that of a man of his own country and his
own time; a high functionary of St. Petersburg;
a future statesman, who had gone into one of the
provinces to examine the petty government
officials.</p>

<p>“Matthew Ilitch belonged to what were called
the younger politicians. Although hardly over
forty years of age, he was already aiming to
obtain a high position in the Government, and
wore two orders on his breast. One of them,
however, was a foreign, and quite an ordinary
one. He passed for one of the progressive party,
as well as the official whom he came to examine.
He had a high opinion of himself; his
personal vanity was boundless, although he
affected an air of studied simplicity, gave you
a look of encouragement, listened with an indulgent
patience. He laughed so good-naturedly
that, at first, you would take him for a ‘good
sort of fellow.’ But, on certain occasions, he
knew how to throw dust in your eyes. ‘It is
necessary to be energetic,’ he used to say; ‘energy
is the first quality of the statesman.’ In spite of
all, he was often duped; for any petty official with
a little experience could lead him by the nose at
will.</p>

<p>“Matthew Ilitch often spoke of Guizot with
admiration; he tried to have every one understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
that he did not belong to the category of
those who followed one routine; but that he was
attentive to every phase and possible requirement
of social life. He kept himself familiar with all
contemporary literature, as he was accustomed to
say, in an off-hand way. He was a tricky and
adroit courtier, nothing more; he really knew
nothing of public affairs, and his views were of no
value whatever; but he understood managing his
own affairs admirably well; on this point he
could not be duped. Is not that, after all, the
principal thing?”</p>

<p>In the intervals of these important works, Turgenef
often wrote little simple sketches, in the
style of his “Annals of a Sportsman.” There are
more than twenty of these exquisitely delicate
compositions. One of them, entitled “Assia,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>
of about sixty pages, is a perfect gem in its way,
and is a souvenir of his student-life in Germany,
and of a love-passage experienced there.</p>

<p>The young student loves a young Russian girl
without being quite conscious of his passion.
His love being evidently reciprocated, the young
girl, wounded by his hesitation, suddenly disappears,
and he knows too late what he has lost.
I will quote at hazard a few lines of this poem in
prose, which is only the prelude of this unconscious
passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
The two young people are walking, one summer
evening, on the banks of the Rhine.</p>

<p>“I stood and looked upon her, bathed as she
was in the bright rays of the setting sun. Her
face was calm and sweet. Everything around us
was beaming with intensity of light; earth, air,
and water.</p>

<p>“‘How beautiful it is!’ I said, involuntarily
lowering my voice.</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ she said, in the same tone, without
raising her eyes. ‘If we were birds, you and I,
would we not soar away and fly? … we should
be lost in those azure depths…. But—we are
not birds.’</p>

<p>“‘Our wings may grow,’ I replied. ‘Only live
on and you will see. There are feelings which
can raise us above this earth. Fear not; you will
have your wings.’</p>

<p>“‘And you,’ she said; ‘have you ever felt
this?’</p>

<p>“‘It seems to me that I never did, until this
moment,’ I said.</p>

<p>“Assia was silent, and seemed absorbed in
thought. I drew nearer to her. Suddenly she
<span class="lock">said:—</span></p>

<p>“‘Do you waltz?’ ‘Yes,’ I replied, somewhat
perplexed by this question.</p>

<p>“‘Come, then,’ she said; ‘I will ask my brother
to play a waltz for us. We will imagine we are
flying, and that our wings have grown….’</p>

“It was late when I left her. On recrossing
the Rhine, when midway between the two shores,
I asked the ferryman to let the boat drift with the
current. The old man raised the oars, and the
royal stream bore us on. I looked around me,
listened, and reflected. I had a feeling of unrest,
and felt a sudden pang at my heart. I raised my
eyes to the heavens; but even there there was no
tranquillity. Dotted with glittering stars, the
whole firmament was palpitating and quivering.
I leaned over the water; there were the same
stars, trembling and gleaming in its cold, gloomy
depths. The agitation of nature all around me
only increased my own. I leaned my elbows
upon the edge of the boat; the night wind, murmuring
in my ears, and the dull plashing of the
water against the rudder irritated my nerves,
which the cool exhalations from the water could
not calm. A nightingale was singing on the
shore, and his song seemed to fill me with a
delicious poison. Tears filled my eyes, I knew
not why. What I now felt was not that aspiration
toward the Infinite, that love for universal
nature, with which my whole being had been
filled of late; but I was consumed by a thirst, a
longing for happiness,—I could not yet call it by
its name, but for a happiness beyond expression,
even if it should annihilate me. It was almost
an agony of mingled joy and pain.</p>

<p>“The boat floated on, while the old boatman sat
and slept, leaning forward upon his oars.”</p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The emancipation of the serfs, the dream of
Turgenef’s life, had become an accomplished fact,
and was, moreover, the inaugurator of other great
reforms. There was a general joyous awakening
of secret forces and of hopes long deferred. The
years following 1860, which were so momentous
for Russia, wrought a change in the interior life
of the poet and author. Torn from his native
land by the ties of a deathless friendship, to
which he unreservedly devoted the remainder of
his life, he left Russia, never to return except at
very rare intervals. He established himself first
at Baden, afterwards settled permanently in
Paris. Every desire of his heart as man, author,
and patriot had been gratified. He had helped to
bring about the emancipation. His literary fame
followed him, and his works were translated into
many languages.</p>

<p>But, after some years of silence and repose,
this poet’s soul, which through youth had rejoiced
in its dreams and anticipations, suffered
the change which must come to our poor human
nature. He was not destined in his old age to
realize his ideals.</p>

<p>In 1868 his great novel “Smoke” appeared.
It exhibited the same talent, riper than ever with
the maturity of age; but the old faith and candor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
were wanting. Were we speaking of any other
man, we should say that he had become bitter;
but that would be an exaggeration in speaking of
Turgenef, for there was no gall in his temperament.
But there are the pathetic touches of a
disenchanted idealist, astonished to find that his
most cherished ideas, applied to men, cannot
make them perfect. This sort of disappointment
sometimes carries an author to injustice; his pencil
shades certain characters too intensely, so that
they are less true to nature than those of his older
works. The phase of society described in “Smoke”
exhibits a class of Russians living abroad, who do
not, perhaps, retain in their foreign home the
best qualities of their native soil: noble lords and
questionable ladies, students and conspirators.
The scene is laid at Baden, where the author
could study society at his leisure. Of this confusing
throng of army officers, rusticating princesses,
boastful Slavophiles, and travelling clerks,
he has given us many a vivid glimpse. But the
book, as a whole, is an exaggeration; and this
impression is all the stronger as the author evidently
does not consider his characters of an
exceptional type, but intends to faithfully represent
Russian society, both high and low. Moreover,
the artist has modified his style. He
formerly presented his array of ideas, and left
his readers to judge of them for themselves; but
now he often puts himself in the reader’s place,
and expresses his own opinion very freely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
For the novelist or dramatist there are two
ways of presenting moral theses; with or without
his personal intervention. We will take the most
familiar <a id="chg2"></a>examples. In Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables,”
there are two conceptions of duty and
virtue, which are perfectly antagonistic, personified
by Jean Valjean and Javert. They are so
perfectly drawn that we might almost hesitate
between them; but the author throws the whole
weight of his eloquence on the one; he deifies
one and depreciates the other, so that he forces
the verdict from us. But in “Le Gendre de M.
Poirier,” on the contrary, there are two conceptions
of honor; two sets of irreconcilable ideas;
those of the Marquis de Presle, and those of his
father-in-law. The author keeps himself in the
background. He presents his two characters with
the same clear analyses of their merits and absurdities;
and shows both the weak and the strong
points of their arguments. Even to the very end
we hesitate to judge between them; and it is this
conflict of ideas which keeps up the interest of the
drama.</p>

<p>For myself, I prefer the second method. Besides
being more artistic, it seems to approach
nearer to real life, in which we can never see
truth clearly, and in which good and evil are
always so closely allied. Turgenef embraced this
method in all his first studies of social life, and
they were more just and true, in my opinion, than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
his later ones. In the last two, “Smoke” and
“Virgin Soil,” he interferes noticeably, bringing
forward his own opinions; but I acknowledge
that these books contain many passages overflowing
with vivid fancy and strong common-sense.
He satirizes everything he disapproves, the <dfn>Slavophile</dfn>
party, all the national peculiarities, especially
that mania for declaring everything perfect that
springs from Russian soil. His shafts of wit,
which he employs to illustrate this infatuation, are
very keen; for example, when he speaks of the
“literature which is bound in Russia leather”;
and when he says, “in my country two and two
make four, but with more certainty than elsewhere.”</p>

<p>After emptying his quiver, the author describes
a love intrigue, in which he shows as ever his
marvellous knowledge of the human heart. But
here again his style has changed. Formerly he
wrote of youthful affection, a loyal emotion, frank
and courageous enough to brave the whole world;
and woman seemed to interest him only in her
early youth. But he depicts in “Smoke” and
“Spring Floods” the most cruel passions, with
their agonies, deceptions, and bottomless abysses.
The virtuous young girl invariably comes in, but
as if held in reserve to save the repentant sinner
at the end. Some may prefer these tempestuous
compositions to the delicious poetic harmonies of
his first romances. It is a matter of taste, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
would not decry the real merit of “Smoke,” which
is a masterpiece in its way. I only affirm that on
the approach of the evening of life the translucent
soul of the poet has given us glimpses of sombre
clouds and stormy skies. At the end of “Spring
Floods,” after that wonderful scene, so true to
life, exhibiting the weakness of the man and the
diabolical power of the woman, there follow a few
pages so full of rancor that you can but feel pity
for the writer who can express such bitterness.</p>

<p>In 1877, “Virgin Soil,” the last long important
work, appeared: first in French, in a Paris journal,
as if to feel its way; then the original could be
risked in Russia with impunity, and had a free circulation.
What a marked change the march of
ideas had produced since the appearance of Turgenef’s
article on Gogol! In this new work the
author traversed a road which once would have led
directly to Siberia. He had the ambition to describe
the subterranean world which at that time
was beginning to threaten the peace of the
Empire. Having studied for twenty-five years
every current of thought springing from Russian
soil, the student thought to perfect his task by
showing us the natural outgrowth of these currents.
Since they disappeared under the earth,
they must be investigated and attacked with a
bold front.</p>

<p>Turgenef was incited to the work partly from
the appearance of a rival, who had already preceded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
him in this line. We shall see that “Virgin
Soil” was an indirect response to “Les Possédés”
of Dostoyevski. The effort was not wholly
successful; as Turgenef had been away from his
native land for fifteen years, he had not been able
to watch narrowly enough the incessant transformation
of that hidden, almost inaccessible
world. Without the closest study from nature
the artist’s work cannot produce striking results.
The novelist intended to present the still unsettled
tendencies of the nihilists in a characteristic
and fixed form; but he failed to give clearness
and outline to the work; the image refused
to reflect its true form. This is why there is something
vague and indistinct about the first part of
“Virgin Soil,” which contrasts unfavorably with
the clear-cut models of his early works.</p>

<p>The author introduces us into the circle of
conspirators at St. Petersburg. One of the young
men, Neshdanof, has been engaged as a tutor in
the house of a rich government official, in a distant
province. He there meets a young girl of
noble family, who is treated as a poor relation in
the house. She is embittered by a long series of
humiliations, and is struck with admiration for the
ideas of the young apostle, more than for his personal
attractions. They escape together, and form
a Platonic union, working together among the
common people, at the great cause of socialism.
But Neshdanof is not fitted for the terrible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
work; he is a weak character, and a dreamer and
poet. Distracted with doubts, and wholly <a id="chg3"></a>discouraged,
he soon discovers that all is chaos within
his soul. He does not love the cause to which he
is sacrificing himself, and he knows not how best to
serve it. Neither does he love the woman who has
sacrificed herself for him, and he feels that he has
lowered himself in her esteem. Weary of life,
too proud to withdraw, and generous enough to
wish to save his devoted companion before her
reputation is lost, Neshdanof takes his life. He
has found out that one of his friends, with more
character than himself, has a secret attachment
for Marianne. Before dying he joins the hands of
those two enthusiastic beings. The romance ends
with a fruitless conspiracy, which shows the utter
uselessness of attempting to stir the people to
revolution.</p>

<p>Other revolutionary characters dimly float
before the reader’s vision, who whisper unintelligible
words. Those from among the higher
classes are treated even more harshly than in
“Smoke.” They have the same self-sufficiency,
and are equally absurd without a single merit;
and you feel that they are presented in a false
light. Hence the work is abounding in caricatures,
and shows a want of balance as a whole.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the apostles of the new
faith are surrounded with a halo of generosity
and devotion. Between extreme egotism on one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
side, and stern faith and utter self-abnegation on
the other, the idealist’s choice must fall. Naturally,
the poet’s warm heart draws him to the most
disinterested party of the two. He invests these
rude natures with delicate sentiments, which
clothe them with poetry; concealing from us,
and even from himself, the revolting contrasts
they present, and their brutal instincts. The
wolfish, energetic Bazarof was of a type more
true to nature.</p>

<p>I think that Turgenef’s sensibility led him
astray in his conception of the nihilists; while
his good-sense did justice to their ideas, exhibited
the puerility of their discourses and the
uselessness of their blind hopes. The most valuable
part of the book is where the writer demonstrates
by facts the utter impossibility of uniting
the propagandists and the people. Abstract arguments
make no impression upon the peasant’s dull
brain. Neshdanof attempts an harangue in an ale-house;
the peasants force him to drink. The
second glass of <dfn>vodka</dfn> intoxicates him completely,
and he staggers away amid jeers and shouts.
Another man, who tries to stir a village to
revolt, is bound and given over to justice.</p>

<p>At times Turgenef strikes exactly at the root
of the evil, shows up the glaring faults of the
revolutionary spirit, and exposes its weakness.
Assuming too much responsibility, the nihilists
wish to raise an ignorant populace at once to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
intellectual heights they have themselves reached;
forgetting that time alone can accomplish such a
miracle. They have recourse to cabalistic formulas,
but their efforts are fruitless. The poet sees
and explains all this; but, being a poet, he allows
himself to be seduced by the sentimental beauty
of the sacrifice, losing sight of the object; while
the proved uselessness of the sacrifice only redoubles
his indulgence towards the victims.</p>

<p>This brings me to a point where I am obliged
to touch upon a delicate subject. Certain political
claims, discussed over the author’s tomb,
have caused much anxiety in Russia; and bitter
resentment threatened to mingle with the national
grief. The Moscow papers published several severe
articles about him before his death, in consequence
of the appearance of his “Memoirs of a
Nihilist” in a French paper. This autobiographical
sketch is not a work of the imagination, for he
obtained the story from the lips of a fellow-countryman
who had escaped from a prison in Russia.</p>

<p>This curious essay has the ring of truth about
it, and no attempt at recrimination; giving an
example of that strange psychological peculiarity
of the Russian, who studies so attentively the
moral effect of suffering upon his soul that he
forgets to accuse the authors of his suffering.
The sketch recalls vividly certain pages of Dostoyevski’s.
But Turgenef’s ideas were not, at this
time, well received by the Russians. They resented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the too indulgent tone of his writings, and
accused him of complicity with the enemies of
the Empire. The radicals wished to claim him
for their own; and it was hinted that he subscribed
to support a seditious journal. This is,
however, entirely improbable. Turgenef was open-hearted
and generous to a fault. He gave freely
and indiscriminately to any one that was suffering.
His door and his purse were open to any fellow-countryman
without reserve, and kind words were
ever ready to flow from his lips. But, though
always ready to help others, he certainly never
gave his aid to any political intriguer. Was it
natural that a man of his refinement and high culture
should have aided the schemes of wild and
fruitless political conspiracies? With the liberal
ideas he adopted during his university life in Germany,
in early youth, he was more inclined to
cherish political dreams than to put his liberalism
into practice. In fact, it is only necessary to read
“Virgin Soil” attentively, to understand the position
he proposed to maintain.</p>

<p>But I am dwelling too long upon the political
standing of a poet. This man, who was honest
and true in the highest degree in all relations of
life, must have been the same as to his politics.
Those who questioned the colors he bore could
ill afford to criticise him.</p>

<p>About this time, Turgenef wrote five or six
tales; one of which (“A Lear of the Steppe”),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
for its intensity of feeling, recalls the most beautiful
parts of “The Annals of a Sportsman.” But
I must not dwell upon these, but give a little
attention to the productions of our author as a
whole.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Ivan Sergievitch (Turgenef) has given us a
most complete picture of Russian society. The
same general types are always brought forward;
and, as later writers have presented exactly similar
ones, with but few modifications, we are
forced to believe them true to life. First, the
peasant; meek, resigned, dull, pathetic in suffering,
like a child who does not know why he
suffers; naturally sharp and tricky when not
stupefied by liquor; occasionally roused to violent
passion. Then, the intelligent middle class;
the small landed proprietors of two generations.
The old proprietor is ignorant and good-natured,
of respectable family, but with coarse habits;
hard, from long experience of serfdom, servile
himself, but admirable in all other relations of
life.</p>

<p>The young man of this class is of quite a different
type. His intellectual growth having been
too rapid, he sometimes plunges into Nihilism.
He is often well educated, melancholy, rich in
ideas but poor in executive ability; always preparing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and expecting to accomplish something of
importance, filled with vague and generous projects
for the public good. This is the chosen
type of hero in all Russian novels. Gogol introduced
it, and Tolstoï prefers it above all others.</p>

<p>The favorite hero of young girls and romantic
women is neither the brilliant officer, the artist,
nor rich lord, but almost universally this provincial
Hamlet, conscientious, cultivated, intelligent,
but of feeble will, who, returning from his studies
in foreign lands, is full of scientific theories about
the improvement of mankind and the good of the
lower classes, and eager to apply these theories
on his own estate. It is quite necessary that he
should have an estate of his own. He will have
the hearty sympathy of the reader in his efforts
to improve the condition of his dependents.</p>

<p>The Russians well understand the conditions of
the future prosperity of their country; but, as
they themselves acknowledge, they know not how
to go to work to accomplish it.</p>

<p>In regard to the women of this class, Turgenef,
strange to say, has little to say of the mothers.
This probably reveals the existence of some old
wound, some bitter experience of his own. Without
a single exception, all the mothers in his
novels are either wicked or grotesque. He reserves
the treasures of his poetic fancy for the young
girls of his creation. To him the young girl of
the country province is the corner-stone of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
fabric of society. Reared in the freedom of country
life, placed in the most healthy social conditions,
she is conscientious, frank, affectionate,
without being romantic; less intelligent than
man, but more resolute. In each of his romances
an irresolute man is invariably guided by a
woman of strong will.</p>

<p>Such are, generally speaking, the characters the
author describes, which bear so unmistakably the
stamp of nature that one cannot refrain from saying
as he closes the book, “These must be portraits
from life!” which criticism is always the
highest praise, the best sanction of works of the
imagination.</p>

<p>But something is wanting to fully complete the
picture of Russian life. Turgenef never has
written of the highest class in society except
incidentally and in his later works, and then in
his bitterest vein. He was never drawn to this
class, and was, besides, prejudiced against it.
The charming young girl, suddenly raised to a
position in this circle, becomes entirely perverted—is
changed into a frivolous woman, with most
disagreeable peculiarities of mind and temperament.
The man, elevated to the new dignities of
a high public position, adds to his native irresolution
ostentatious pride and folly. We are
forced to question these hasty and extreme statements.
We must wait for Leo Tolstoï before
forming our opinions. He will give us precisely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the same types of the lower and middle classes as
his predecessor; but he will also give a most
complete analysis of the statesman, the courtier,
and the noble dames of the court. He will finish
the edifice, the foundations of which Turgenef
has so admirably laid. Not that we expect of
our author the complicated intrigues and extraordinary
adventures of the old French romances.
He shows us life as it is, not through a magic
lantern. Facts interest him but little, for he
only regards them as to their influence on the
human soul. He loved to study character and
sentiment, to seek the simplest personages of
every-day life; and the great secret of his power
lies in his having felt such deep interest in his
models that his characters are never prosaic,
while absolutely true to life. He says of Neshdanof,
in “Virgin Soil”: “He makes realism
poetic.” These, his own words, may be justly
applied to himself. In exquisite and good taste
he has, in fact, no rival. On every page we find
a tender grace like the ineffable freshness of
morning dew. A phrase of George Eliot’s, in
“Adam Bede,” may well apply to him: “Words
came to me as tears come when the heart is full
and we cannot prevent them.”</p>

<p>No writer ever had more sentiment or a greater
horror of sentimentality; none could better express
in a single phrase such crises, such remarkable
situations. This reserve power makes his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
work unique in Russian literature, which is
always diffuse and elaborate. In his most unimportant
productions there is an artistic conciseness
equal to that of the great masters of the
ancient classics. Such qualities, made still more
effective by a perfection of style and a diction
always correct and sometimes most exquisite,
give to Turgenef a very high position in contemporary
literature. Taine considered him one of
the most perfect artists the world has produced
since the classic period. English criticism, generally
considered somewhat cold, and not given to
exaggeration, places him among writers of the
very first rank.</p>

<p>I subscribe to this opinion whenever I take up
any of his works to read once again; then I hesitate
when I think of that marvellous Tolstoï,
who captivates my imagination and makes me
suspend my judgment. We must leave these
questions of precedence for the future to decide.</p>

<p>After the appearance of “Virgin Soil,” although
Turgenef’s talent suffered no change, and his intelligence
was as keen as ever, his mind seemed
to need repose, and to be groping for some hidden
path, as is often the case with young authors
at the beginning of their career. There were
good reasons for this condition of discouragement.
Turgenef reaped many advantages, and some
disadvantages, from his prolonged sojourn in our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
midst. At first, the study of new masters and
the friendships and advice of Mérimée, were of
great use to him. To this literary intercourse
may be attributed the rare culture, clearness, and
precision of his works, as distinguished from any
other prose writer of his country. Later on he
became an enthusiastic admirer of Flaubert, and
made some excellent translations of his works.
Then, next to the pioneers of the “School of
Nature,” he adhered to their successors, fondly
imagining himself to be one of them, giving ear
to their doctrines, and making frantic efforts to
conciliate these with his old ideals. Moreover, he
felt himself more and more widely separated from
his native land, the true source of all his ideas.
He was sometimes reproached as a deserter.
The tendencies of his last novels had aroused
recrimination and scandal. Whenever he occasionally
visited St. Petersburg or Moscow, he was
received with ovations by the young men, but
with extreme coldness in some circles. He was
destined to live to see a part of his former adherents
leave him and run to worship new idols.
On his last appearance in Russia for the fêtes in
honor of Pushkin, the Moscow students rushed to
take him from his carriage, and bear him in their
arms; but I remember that one day at St. Petersburg,
returning from a visit to one of the nobility,
Ivan Sergievitch (Turgenef) said to us, in
a jesting tone, not quite free from bitterness:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
“Some one called me Ivan Nikolaievitch.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
This little inadvertency would to us seem quite
pardonable, for here we are, fortunately, not
obliged to know every one’s father’s name. But,
considering Russian customs, this oversight in
the case of a national celebrity was an offence,
and showed that he was already beginning to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>About this time I had the good-fortune to pass
an evening with Turgenef and Skobelef. The
young general spoke with his habitual eloquence
and warmth of his hopes for the future, and
expressed many great thoughts. The old author
listened in silence, studying him meanwhile with
that pensive, concentrated expression of the artist
when he wishes to reproduce an image in
form and color. The model was posing for the
painter, who meant to engraft this remarkable
character into one of his books; but Death did
not permit the hero to live out his romance, nor
the poet to write it.</p>

<p>One day in the spring of 1883, the last time I
had the honor of seeing Ivan Sergievitch, we
spoke of Skobelef. He said: “I shall soon follow
him.”</p>

<p>It was too true. He was suffering terribly
from the mortal illness of which he died soon
after—a cancer in the spinal marrow. His eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
rested upon a landscape of Rousseau, his favorite
painter, which represented an ancient oak, torn
by the storms of many winters, now shedding its
last crimson leaves in a December gale. There
was an affinity between the noble old man and
this picture which he enjoyed looking upon, a
secret and mutual understanding of the decrees
of Nature.</p>

<p>He published three tales after being attacked
with this fatal disease. It is an example of the
irony of fate that the last of these was entitled
“Despair.” This was his last analysis of the
Russian character, which he had made his study
for so many years, and reproduced in all his
works.</p>

<p>A few days before his death he took up his
pen to write a touching epistle to his friend, Leo
Tolstoï. In this farewell the dying author bequeathed
the care and honor of Russian literature
to his friend and rival. I give the closing words
of this <span class="lock">letter:—</span></p>

<p>“My very dear Leo Nikolaievitch, I have not
written to you for a long time, for I have long
been upon my death-bed. There is no chance for
recovery; it is not to be thought of. I write
expressly to tell you how very happy I am to
have been a contemporary of yours; and to
express a last, urgent request.</p>

<p>“My friend, return to your literary labors.
This gift has come to you from whence come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
all our gifts. Oh! how happy I should be could
I feel that you will grant this request!…</p>

<p>“My dear friend, great author of our beloved
Russia, let me entreat you to grant me this request!
Reply if this reaches you. I press you
and yours to my heart for the last time. I can
write no more…. I am weary!…”</p>

<p>We can only hope that this exhortation will be
obeyed by the only author worthy to take up the
pen dropped by those valiant hands.</p>

<p>Turgenef has left behind a rich legacy; for
every page he ever wrote, with but very few
exceptions, breathes a noble spirit; and his works
will continue to elevate and warm the hearts of
thousands.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[F]</a>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
<br>
<span class="allsmcap">THE RELIGION OF ENDURANCE.—DOSTOYEVSKI.</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">With</span> Dostoyevski, that true Scythian, who
will revolutionize all our previous habits of
thought, we now enter into the heart of Moscow,
with its giant cathedral of St. Basil, like a
Chinese pagoda as to form and decoration, and
built by Tartar architects; but dedicated to the
worship of the Christian’s God.</p>

<p>Turgenef and Dostoyevski, although contemporaries,
belonging to the same school, and borne
on by the same current of ideas, present in their
respective works many sharply defined contrasts;
still, they possess one quality in common, the
outgrowth of the period in which they lived—sympathy
for humanity. In Dostoyevski, this
sympathy has developed into an intense pity for
the humbler class, which regards him and believes
in him as its master.</p>

<p>All contemporary forms of art have secret
bonds in common. The same causes and sentiments
which inclined these Russian authors to
the study of real life attracted the great French
landscape-painters of the same epoch to a closer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
observation of nature. The works of Corot,
Rousseau, and Millet present to me a perfect
idea of the common tendencies and personal
peculiarities of the three types of talent I
am attempting to analyze. Whichever of these
painters we prefer, we shall be likely to be
attracted by the corresponding writer. I would
not force such a comparison; but to me Turgenef
has the grace and poetry of Corot; Tolstoï,
the simple grandeur of Rousseau; Dostoyevski,
the tragic severity of Millet.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski’s romances have been translated
into French, and, to my astonishment, they are
greatly enjoyed by the French. This places me
at ease in discussing him. I should never have
been believed, in attempting to present an analysis
of this strange character, if these books, which
reflect and typify their author, had not been well
known among us. At the same time, the books
can scarcely be understood without some knowledge
of the life of him who created them. I had
almost said, whose life and sufferings were portrayed
in them; but the one expression partly
implies the other.</p>

<p>On entering into an examination of the life
and works of this man, I must present to the
reader scenes invariably sad, sometimes terrible,
sometimes funereal. Those persons should not
attempt to read them who object to visiting hospitals,
courts of justice, or prisons; or who have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
a horror of visiting graveyards at night. I cannot
conscientiously throw a cheerful glamour
upon what both destiny and character have
made sombre throughout. Some will, at least,
follow me with confidence. At all events, the
Russia of the past twenty years will remain an
inexplicable enigma to those who ignore the
work which has made the most lasting impression
upon this country, and shaken it to its foundations.
We must, then, examine the books which
have performed such a work, and, first of all, and
more dramatic than all, the life of him who conceived
them.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>He was born at Moscow, in 1821, in the charity
hospital. Destiny decreed that his eyes should
first open upon the sad spectacle which was to
be ever before them, and upon the most terrible
forms of misery. His father, a retired military
surgeon, was attached to this establishment. His
family belonged to one of those lower orders of
the nobility from which minor functionaries are
generally chosen, and possessed a small estate
and a few serfs in the province of Tula. The
child was sometimes taken out to this country
place; and these first visions of country life occasionally
reappear in his works, but very rarely.
Contrary to the habit of the other Russian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
authors, who adore nature, and especially love
the place where they were reared, Dostoyevski
is not attracted in this direction. He is
a psychologist; the human soul absorbs his
entire vision; the scenes of his choice are the
suburbs of large cities, and miserable alleys. In
his childish recollections, which almost invariably
give their coloring to an author’s mind, you never
feel the influence of peaceful woods and broad,
open skies. The source from whence his imagination
draws its supplies will give you glimpses of
hospital courts, pallid faces under the regulation
white cap, and forms clothed in brown robes;
and you will encounter the timid gaze of the
“Degraded” and “Insulted.”</p>

<p>Dostoyevski was one of a numerous family of
children, and his life as a child was not one of luxury.
After leaving a Moscow school, his father
procured admission for the two elder sons, Alexis
and Feodor, to the military engineering school at
St. Petersburg. The two brothers, bound together
by a common aptitude for literature, were
always deeply attached to each other, and greatly
depended, in all the crises of life, upon each
other’s mutual support. We gain much knowledge
of the interior life of Feodor Mikhailovitch,
(Dostoyevski) through his letters to his brother
Alexis in his “Correspondence.” Both felt themselves
out of place in this school, which, for
them, took the place of a University training. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
classical education was just what Dostoyevski
needed; it would have given him that refinement
and balance which is gained by an early training
in the best literature. He made up for the want
of it as best he could, by reading Pushkin and
Gogol, and the French romance-writers, Balzac,
Eugene Sue, and George Sand, who seems to have
had a strong influence upon his imagination.
But Gogol was his favorite master. The humble
world which attracted him most was revealed to
him in “Dead Souls.”</p>

<p>Leaving the school in 1843 with the grade of
sub-lieutenant, he did not long wear his engineer’s
uniform. A year later he sent in his resignation,
to devote himself exclusively to literary
occupations. From this day, the fierce struggle
of our author with poverty began which was to
last forty years. After the father’s death the
meagre patrimony was divided among the children,
and it quickly vanished. The young Feodor
undertook translations for journals and publishers.
For forty years his correspondence,
which recalls that of Balzac, was one long agonizing
lament; a recapitulation of debts accumulating
and weighing upon him, a complaint of the
slavish life he led. For years he is never sure of
his daily bread, except in the convict prison.</p>

<p>Although Dostoyevski became hardened to
material privations, he was not proof against the
moral wounds which poverty inflicts; the pitiable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
pride which formed the foundation of his character
suffered terribly from everything which
betrayed his poverty. You feel the existence
of this open wound in his letters; and all his
heroes, the real incarnations of his own soul, suffer
the same torture. Moreover, he was really ill,
a victim of shattered nerves; and he became so
visionary that he believed himself threatened
with every imaginable disease. He left on his
table sometimes, before retiring for the night, a
paper upon which he wrote: “I may to-night
fall into a lethargic sleep; be careful not to bury
me before a certain number of days.” This was
no trick of the imagination, but a presentiment of
the fatal malady, of which he then felt the first
symptoms. It has been stated that he contracted
it in Siberia later than this; but a friend of his
youth assures me that at this very time he was
in the habit of falling down in the street foaming
at the mouth. He always was, what he seemed to
us to be in his latter years, but a frail bundle of
irritable nerves; a feminine soul in the frame of
a Russian peasant; reserved, savage, full of hallucinations;
while the deepest tenderness filled his
heart when he looked upon the sufferings of the
lower classes.</p>

<p>His work was his sole consolation and delight.
He narrates in his letters projected plots for his
romances with the most genuine enthusiasm; and
the recollection of these first transports makes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
him put into the mouth of one of his characters,
drawn from himself, the novelist who figures in
“The Degraded and Insulted,”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> the following
<span class="lock">expressions:—</span></p>

<p>“If I ever was happy, it was not during the
first intoxicating moments of success, but at the
time when I had never read nor shown my manuscript
to any one; during those long nights,
passed in enthusiastic dreams and hopes, when
I passionately loved my work; when I lived with
my fancies, with the characters created by me, as
with real relatives, living beings. I loved them;
I rejoiced or mourned with them, and I have actually
shed bitter tears over the misfortunes of my
poor hero.”</p>

<p>His first tale, “Poor People,” contained the
germ of all the rest. He wrote it at the age of
twenty-three. During the latter years of his life,
he used to relate the story of this first venture.
The poor little engineer knew not a single soul in
the literary world, or what to do with his manuscript.
One of his comrades, Grigorovitch, who
became a man of considerable literary reputation,
has confirmed this anecdote. He carried the
manuscript to Nekrasof, the poet, and friend of
poor authors.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning, Dostoyevski
heard a knock at his door. It was Grigorovitch,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
who brought Nekrasof in with him. The poet
threw himself upon the young stranger’s neck,
showing strong emotion. He had been up the
whole night, reading the tale, and was perfectly
carried away with it. He too lived the cautious
and hidden life which at that time was the lot
of every Russian writer. These two repressed
hearts, mutually and irresistibly attracted to each
other, now overflowed with all the generous enthusiasm
of youth. The dawn of day found the
three enthusiasts still absorbed in an exalted conversation
and an interchange of thoughts, hopes,
and artistic and poetical dreams.</p>

<p>On leaving his protégé, Nekrasof went directly
to Bielinski, the oracle of Russian literature, the
only critic formidable to young beginners. “A
new Gogol is born to us!” cried the poet, as he
entered his friend’s house. “Gogols sprout up
nowadays like mushrooms,” replied the critic,
with his most forbidding air, as he took up the
manuscript, handling it as if it were something
poisonous, in the same way that all great critics
of every country treat new manuscripts. But
when Bielinski had read the manuscript through,
its effect upon him was magical; so that when
the trembling young man presented himself before
his judge, the latter cried out <span class="lock">excitedly:—</span></p>

<p>“Do you comprehend, young man, all the truth
that you have described? No! at your age, that
is quite impossible. This is a revelation of art,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
an inspiration, a gift from on high. Reverence,
preserve this gift! and you will become a great
writer!”</p>

<p>A few months later “Poor People” appeared in
periodical review, and Russia ratified the verdict
of its great critic. Bielinski’s astonishment was
justifiable; for it seems incredible that any person
of twenty could have produced a tragedy at once
so simple and so heart-rending. In youth, happiness
is our science, learned without a master, and
we invent grand, heroic, showy misfortunes, and
anguish which blazons its own sublimity. But
how had this unhappy genius learned the meaning
of that hidden, dumb, wearing misery before
his time?</p>

<p>It is but an ordinary story, told in a correspondence
between two persons. An inferior
clerk in a court of chancery, worn with years and
toil, is passing on toward the decline of life, in a
continual struggle with poverty and the accompanying
tortures of wounded self-love. This
ignorant and honest clerk, the butt of his comrades’
ridicule, ordinary in conversation, of only
medium intelligence, whose whole ambition is to
be a good copyist, possesses, under an almost
grotesque exterior, a heart as fresh, open, and
affectionate as that of a little child; and I might
almost say, sublimely stupid, indifferent to his own
interests, in his noble generosity. This is the
chosen type of all the best Russian authors, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
one which exemplifies what is noblest in the
Russian character; as, for example, Turgenef’s
Lukeria in the “Living Relics,” and the Karatayef
of Tolstoï in “War and Peace.” But these are
of the peasant class, whereas the character of
Dievushkin, in “Poor People,” is raised some
degrees higher in the intellectual and social scale.</p>

<p>In this life, dark and cold as the long December
night in Russia, there is one solitary ray of light,
one single joy. In another poor lodging, just
opposite the loft where the clerk copies his papers,
lives a young girl, a distant relative, a solitary
waif like himself, who can claim nothing in the
world but the feeble protection of this friend.
Both isolated, crushed by the brutal pressure of
circumstances, these two unfortunates depend
upon each other for mutual affection, as well as
aid to keep them from starving. In the man’s
affection there is a tender self-sacrifice, a delicacy,
so much the more charming in that it accords not
at all with the habitual bungling awkwardness of
his ways and ideas; like a flower growing in sterile
soil, among brambles, and betrayed only by its
perfume. He imposes upon himself privations
truly heroic, for the sake of comforting and
gladdening the existence of his dear friend.
These are, moreover, so well concealed that they
are only discovered through some awkwardness
on his part; as for him, they seem to him a matter
of course. His sentiments are by turns those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
a father, a brother, a good faithful dog. He would
define them thus himself if called upon to analyze
them. But although we well know a name for
this feeling, let us not even whisper it to him; he
would be overcome with shame at the mere mention
of it.</p>

<p>The woman’s character is drawn with marvellous
art. She is very superior to her friend in
mind and education; she guides him in all intellectual
things, which are quite new to him.
She is weak by nature, and tender-hearted, but less
faithful and resigned than he. She has not wholly
given up a desire for the good things of life. She
continually protests against the sacrifices which
Dievushkin imposes upon himself, she begs him
not to trouble himself for her; but sometimes a
longing cry for something she feels the deprivation
of escapes her, or perhaps a childish desire for
some trifle or finery. The two neighbors can only
see each other occasionally, that they may give
no occasion for malicious gossip, and an almost
daily correspondence has been established between
them. In these letters we read of their past, the
hard lives they have lived, the little incidents of
their every-day life, their disappointments; the
terrors of the young girl, pursued by the vicious,
who try to entrap her; the agonies of the poor
clerk, working for his daily bread, trying so pitifully
to preserve the dignity of his manhood
through the cruel treatment of those who would
strip him of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Finally, the crisis comes; Dievushkin loses his
only joy in life. You think, perhaps, that a
young lover comes to steal her from him, that
love will usurp in her heart the place of sisterly
affection. Oh, no! the tale is much more human,
far sadder.</p>

<p>A man who had once before sought out this
young girl, with possibly doubtful intentions, offers
her his hand. He is middle-aged, rich, of rather
questionable character; but his proposition is an
honorable one. Weary of wrestling against fate,
persuaded perhaps also that she may thereby
lighten some of the burdens of her friend, the
unfortunate girl accepts the offer. Here the
study of character is absolutely true to nature.
The young girl, going suddenly from extreme
poverty to luxury, is intoxicated for a moment
by this new atmosphere, fine dresses, and jewels!
In her cruel ingenuousness, she fills the last
letters with details upon these grave subjects.
From force of habit, she asks this kind Dievushkin,
who always made all her purchases, to do an
errand at the jeweller’s for her. Can her soul be
really base, unworthy of the pure sentiment she
had inspired? Not for a moment does the reader
have such an impression, the writer knows so well
how to maintain true harmony in his delineation
of character. No, it is only that a little of youth
and human nature have come to the surface in
the experience of this long repressed soul. How
can we grudge her such a trifling pleasure?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Then this cruelty is explained by the complete
misapprehension of their reciprocal feelings. With
her it is only a friendship, which will ever be
faithful, grateful, if perhaps a little less single;
how can she possibly understand that for him it is
nothing short of despair?</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the wedded pair
should start immediately after the marriage for a
distant province. Up to the very last hour,
Dievushkin replies to her letters, giving her the
most minute details of the shopping that he has
done for her, making great efforts to become
versed in the subject of laces and ribbons. He
only occasionally betrays a hint of the terror
which seizes him at the thought of the near
separation; but finally, in the last letter, his
wounded heart breaks; the unhappy man sees
before him the blank desolation of his future
life, solitary, empty; he is no longer conscious of
what he writes; but, in spite of all, his utter
distress is kept back; he himself seems hardly
yet to realize the secret of his own agony. The
drama ends with an agonizing wail of despair,
when he is left standing alone, behind the departing
train.</p>

<p>I should like to quote many passages; I hesitate,
and find none. This is the highest eulogium
that can be bestowed upon a romance. The
structure is so solid, the materials so simple, and
so completely sacrificed to the impression of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
whole, that a detached fragment quite loses its
effect; it means no more than a single stone
torn from a Greek temple, whose beauty consists
in its general lines. This is the peculiar attribute
of all the great Russian authors.</p>

<p>Another trait is also common to them, in which
Turgenef excelled, and in which perhaps Dostoyevski
even surpassed him: the art of awaking
with a single line, sometimes with a word, infinite
harmonies, a whole series of sentiments
and ideas. “Poor People” is a perfect specimen
of this art. The words you read upon the paper
seem to produce reverberations, as, when touching
the key-board of an organ, the sounds produced
awake, through invisible tubes, the great interior
heart of harmony within the instrument, whence
come its deepest tones of thunder.</p>

<p>When you have read the last page you feel
that you know the two characters as perfectly as
if you had lived with them for years; moreover,
the author has not told us a thousandth part of
what we know of them, his mere indications are
such revelations; for it seems he is especially
effective in what he leaves unsaid, but merely
suggests, and we are grateful to him for what he
leaves us to imagine.</p>

<p>Into this tender production Dostoyevski has
poured his own nature, all his sensibility, his
longing for sympathy and devotion, his bitter
conception of life, his savage, pitiable pride. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
own letters of this period are like Dievushkin’s,
where he speaks of his inconceivable mortification
on account of his “wretched overcoat.”</p>

<p>In order to understand the high estimation of
this work held by Bielinski and Nekrasof, and to
realize its remarkable originality, we must remember
its time and place in Russian literature. The
“Annals of a Sportsman” did not appear until
five years later. True, Gogol had furnished the
theme in “Le Manteau,” but Dostoyevski substituted
a suggestive emotion in place of his master’s
fancy.</p>

<p>He continued to write essays in the same vein,
but they were less remarkable, and he even tried
his hand at writing a farce; but destiny rudely
led him back into his true path, and gave the
man his peculiarly tragic physiognomy among
writers.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>About the year 1847 the students’ clubs already
mentioned, which assembled to discuss the
doctrines of Fourier and others, opened to receive
political writers and army officers, and were at
this time under the direction of a former student,
the political agitator Petrachevski. The conspiracy
headed by this man is still imperfectly understood,
as well as the general history of that time.
It is, however, certain that two different currents
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of ideas divided these circles. One embraced
those of their predecessors, the revolutionists of
December, 1825, who went no farther than to
indulge in dreams of the emancipation and of a
liberal government. The other set went far beyond
their successors, the present nihilists, for they
desired the total ruin of the entire social edifice.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski’s character, as we have seen, made
him an easy prey to radical ideas through his
generosity as well as his hardships and his rebellious
spirit. He has related how he was attracted
toward socialism by the influence of his learned
protector, Bielinski, who tried also to convert
him to atheism.</p>

<p>Our author soon became an enthusiastic member
of the reunions inspired by Petrachevski.
He was, undoubtedly, among the more moderate,
or rather one of the independent dreamers. Mysticism,
sympathy for the unfortunate, these must
have been what attracted him in any political
doctrine; and his incapacity for action made this
metaphysician altogether harmless. The sentence
pronounced upon him charged him with
very pardonable errors: participation in the reunions;
also in the discussions on the severity of
the press censure; the reading or listening to the
reading of seditious pamphlets, etc. These
crimes seem very slight when compared with
the severe punishment they provoked. The
police force was then so inefficient that it for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
two years remained ignorant of what was going
on in these circles; but finally they were betrayed
by an unfaithful member.</p>

<p>Petrachevski and his friends also betrayed
themselves at a banquet in honor of Fourier,
where they were discussing the destruction of
family ties, property, kings, and deities. Dostoyevski
took no part in these social banquets, that
occurred just after those days of June in France
which spread terror throughout all Europe, and
only one year after other banquets which had
overturned a throne. The Emperor Nicholas, although
naturally humane, now forced himself to
be implacable, entertaining the firm conviction
that he was the chosen servant of God to save a
sinking world. He was already meditating the
emancipation of the serfs; by a fatal misunderstanding
he was now going to strike down men,
some of whom had committed no crime but that
of desiring the same reform. History is only
just when she seeks the motives of all consciences
and the springs of their actions. But this was
not a favorable time for explanations or cool
judgments.</p>

<p>On the 23d of April, 1849, at five o’clock in the
morning, thirty-three persons looked upon as suspicious
characters were arrested, the Dostoyevski
brothers being among the number. The prisoners
were carried to the citadel, and placed in solitary
confinement in the gloomy casemates, which were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
haunted by the most terrible associations. They
remained there eight months, with no distractions
except the visits of the examining commissioners;
finally, they were allowed the use of a few religious
books. Feodor Mikhailovitch wrote once to
his brother, who had been soon released through
the want of sufficient evidence against him:
“For five months I have lived upon my own substance;
that is, upon my own brain alone….
To think constantly, and receive no outside impression
to renew and sustain thought, is wearing….
I was as if placed under a receiver from
which all the pure air was extracted….”</p>

<p>On the 22d of December the prisoners were
led out, without being informed of the sentence
which had been pronounced upon them. There
were now only 21, the others having been discharged.
They were conducted to a square
where a scaffold had been erected. The cold was
intense; the criminals were ordered to remove all
their clothing, except their shirts, and listen to
the reading of the sentence, which would last for
a half-hour. When the sheriff began to read,
Dostoyevski said to the prisoner next him: “Is it
possible that we are going to be executed?” The
idea seemed to have occurred to him for the first
time. His companion pointed to a cart, loaded
with what appeared to be coffins covered over
with a cloth. The last words of the sentence
were: “They are condemned to death, and are
to be shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
The sheriff left the scaffold, and a priest mounted
upon it with a cross in his hand, and exhorted the
prisoners to confess. Only one responded to
this exhortation; all the others kissed the cross.
Petrachevski and two of the principal conspirators
were bound to the pillar. The officer ordered
the company of soldiers drawn up for the purpose
to charge their weapons. As they were taking aim,
a white flag was hoisted in front of them, when
the twenty-one prisoners heard that the Emperor
had commuted their penalty to exile in Siberia.
The leaders were unbound; one of them, Grigoref,
was struck with sudden insanity, and never recovered.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski, on the contrary, has often assured
me, as if he were really convinced of it, that
he should inevitably have gone mad if he had
not been removed by this and following disasters
from the life he was leading. Before his
imprisonment he was beset by imaginary maladies,
nervous depression, and “mystic terrors,” which
condition would certainly have brought about
mental derangement, from which he was only
saved by this sudden change in his way of life,
and by the necessity of steeling himself against
his overwhelming trials,—which may have been
true, for it is said that imaginary evils are best
cured by real ones; still, I cannot but think that
there was some degree of pride in this affirmation.</p>

<p>In each of his books he depicts a scene similar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
to what he himself experienced, and he has
labored to make a perfect psychological study of
the condemned prisoner who is about to die.
You feel that these pages are the result of a
nightmare, proceeding from some hidden recess of
the author’s own brain.</p>

<p>The imperial decree, which was less severe for
him than for any of the rest, reduced his punishment
to four years of hard labor, after which he
was to serve as a common soldier, losing his rank
among the nobles as well as all civil rights.</p>

<p>The exiled prisoners started immediately in
sledges for Siberia. At Tobolsk, after one night
passed together, when they bade each other farewell,
they were put in irons, their heads shaved,
and they were then sent to their several destinations.
It was at that temporary prison that they
were visited by the wives of the revolutionists of
December. These brave women had set a noble
example. Belonging to the upper class, and
accustomed to a life of luxury, they had renounced
everything to follow their exiled husbands into
Siberia, and for twenty-five years had haunted the
prison gates. Learning now of the arrival of another
set of refugees, they came to visit them,
warned these young men of what was in store for
them, and counselled them how best to support
their hardships, offering to each of them all that
they had to give, the Gospel.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski accepted his, and throughout the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
four years always kept it under his pillow. He
read it every evening under the lamp in the
dormitory, and taught others to read in it. After
the hard day’s work, while his companions in
chains were restoring their wasted energies in
sleep, he obtained from his book a consolation
more necessary still for a thinking man, a renewal
of moral strength, and a support in bearing his
trials. How can we imagine this intellectual
man, with his delicate nervous organization, his
overweening pride, his sensitive imagination,
prone to exaggeration of every dreaded evil, condemned
to the companionship of these low
wretches in such a monotonous existence, forced
to daily labor; and for the slightest negligence,
or at the caprice of his keepers, threatened with a
flogging by the soldiers! He was inscribed among
the worst set of malefactors and political criminals,
who were kept under military surveillance.</p>

<p>They were employed in turning a grindstone
for marble works, in demolishing old boats on
the ice in winter, and other rough and useless
labor.</p>

<p>How well he has described the weariness of
being forced to labor merely for the sake of being
employed, feeling that his task is nothing but a
gymnastic exercise. He has also said the severest
trial of all, was never being allowed to be alone
for a single moment for years. But the greatest
torture of all for this writer, now at the height of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
his powers, incessantly haunted by images and
ideas, was the impossibility of writing, of alleviating
his lot by absorbing himself in some literary
work. But he survived, and was strengthened and
purified, and the personal history of this martyr
can be read in his “Recollections of a Dead
House,”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> which he wrote after he left the prison.
How unjust is literary fame, and what a thing
of chance it is! The name and work of Silvio
Pellico are known throughout the civilized world.
In France the book is one of the classics; and yet
there, on the great highway of all fame and of all
great thoughts, even the title of this tragic work
of Dostoyevski’s was but yesterday quite unknown,—a
book as superior to that of the Lombard
prisoner, as the tales exceed his in horror.</p>

<p>No work was ever more difficult to accomplish.
Siberia, that mysterious land which was then only
mentioned with extreme caution, must be freely
described. It was, too, a former political prisoner
who now undertook to walk over these burning
coals and brave this cruel press-censure. He was
successful; and he made us realize what exquisite
refinement of suffering a man of the upper class,
thrown amid such surroundings, was capable of
enduring.</p>

<p>He gives us the biography of such a man, who
had been through many years of hard labor, the
penalty of some small crime. This man, who is,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
in reality, no other than Dostoyevski himself,
occupies himself in psychological studies of these
unfortunates, aiming constantly to show the divine
spark always existing even in the most degraded.
Many of them relate the story of their lives to
him; with some he seeks to know nothing of
their past, but contents himself with describing
their moral natures in his broad, vague manner,
which is also common to all the great Russian
writers. These portraits, with their indistinct
outlines, melting as into the grayness of the early
dawn, recall Henner’s portraits when compared
with those of Ingres. The language, too, which
Dostoyevski purposely employs, of a popular type,
is marvellously well fitted for his purpose.</p>

<p>The greater part of these natures belong to a
type of character which Dostoyevski seems
peculiarly to enjoy analyzing; those natures
which are subject to attacks of caprice, almost
amounting to sudden or temporary insanity. In
a romance of his, called “The Idiot,” he quotes an
example of this kind, which he declares to be
strictly true:—“Two peasants, of middle age
and friends of long standing, arrived at an inn.
Neither of them was at all intoxicated. They
took their tea and ordered a bedroom, which they
shared together. One of them had noticed that
within the last few days his companion had worn
a silver watch, which he never had seen him wear
before. The man was no thief; he was an honest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
man, and, moreover, in very comfortable circumstances
for a peasant. But this watch so struck
his fancy that he conceived a most inordinate
desire to possess it, which he could not repress.
He seized a knife, and, as soon as his friend’s back
was turned, he approached him noiselessly, raised
his eyes to heaven, crossed himself, and devoutly
murmured this prayer: ‘Lord, forgive me,
through Jesus Christ!’ He then killed his friend
with as much ease as he would a sheep, and took
the watch.”</p>

<p>Those persons who conceive a desire, when on
the top of a high tower, to throw themselves into
the abyss below, he says are often of a mild,
peaceable, and quite ordinary type. Some natures
apparently enjoy the anticipation of the
horror they can inspire in others, and, in a fit of
desperation, seem to court punishment as a
solution of their condition of mind. Sometimes
in these attacks of madness is mingled a vein of
asceticism. Dostoyevski introduces an instance
of this kind in “Crime and Punishment,” which
illustrates the strange sense which the Russian
peasant attaches to the idea of punishment, sought
for itself, for its propitiatory <span class="lock">virtue:—</span></p>

<p>“This prisoner was quite different from all the
rest. He was a little pale thin man, about 60
years of age. I was struck with his appearance
the first time I saw him, there was so much calmness
and repose about him. I particularly liked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
his eyes, which were clear and intelligent. I
often talked with him, and have seldom met with
so kindly a nature, so upright a soul. He was
expiating in Siberia an unpardonable crime. In
consequence of several conversions in his parish,
a movement towards the old orthodoxy, the government,
wishing to encourage these good tendencies,
had an orthodox church built. This man,
together with a few other fanatics, determined to
‘resist for his faith’s sake,’ and set fire to the
church. The instigators of the crime were all condemned
to hard labor in Siberia. He had been a
very successful tradesman at the head of a flourishing
business. Leaving his wife and children at
home, he accepted his sentence with firmness, in his
blindness considering his punishment as a ‘witness
to his faith.’ He was mild and gentle as a
child, and one could not but wonder how he could
have committed such a deed. I often conversed
with him on matters of faith. He yielded up
none of his convictions, but never in argument
betrayed the least hatred or resentment; nor did
I ever discover in him the least indication of
pride or braggadocio. In the prison he was
universally respected, and did not show a trace of
vanity on this account. The prisoners called him
‘our little uncle,’ and never disturbed him in
any way. I could realize what sway he must
have had over his companions in the faith.</p>

<p>“In spite of the apparent courage with which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
he bore his fate, a secret constant pain, which he
tried to hide from all eyes, seemed at times to
consume him. We slept in the same dormitory.
I waked one morning at four o’clock, and heard
what sounded like stifled sobbing. The old man
was sitting on the porcelain stove reading in a
manuscript prayer-book. He was weeping bitterly,
and I heard him murmur from time to
time: ‘O Lord! do not forsake me! Lord,
give me strength! My little children, my dearest
little ones, we shall never see each other
again!’ I felt such inexpressible pity for him!”</p>

<p>I must also translate a terrible piece of realism,
the death of Mikhailof: “I knew him but slightly;
he was a young man about twenty-five years of
age, tall, slender, and had a remarkably fine
form. He belonged to the section in which the
worst criminals were placed, and was always
extremely reticent and seemed very sad and depressed.
He had literally wasted away in prison.
I remember that his eyes were very fine, and I
know not why his image so often comes before
me. He died in the afternoon of a fine, clear,
frosty day. I remember how the sun shone
obliquely through our greenish window-panes,
thickly covered with frost. The bright shaft
of sunlight shone directly upon this poor unfortunate,
as he lay dying. Though he might have
been unconscious, he had a hard struggle, the
death agony lasting many hours. He had recognized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
no one since morning. We tried to relieve
his suffering, which evidently was intense; he
breathed with great difficulty, with a rattling
sound, and his chest labored heavily. He threw
off all his coverings and tore his shirt, as if the
weight of it was insupportable. We went to his
aid and took the shirt off. That emaciated body
was a terrible sight, the legs and arms wasted to
the bone, every rib visible like those of a skeleton.
Only his chains and a little wooden cross remained
upon him. His wasted feet might almost have
escaped through the rings of the fetters.</p>

<p>“For a half-hour before his death all sounds
ceased in our dormitory, and no one spoke above
a whisper, and all moved as noiselessly as possible.
Finally his hand, wavering and uncertain, sought
the little cross, and tried to tear it off, as if even
that was too heavy a weight and was stifling him.
They took it away, and ten minutes after he
expired. They went to inform the guard, who
came and looked indifferently upon the corpse,
then went to call the health officer, who came
immediately, approached the dead man with a
rapid step which resounded in the silent chamber,
and with a professional air of indifference,
assumed for the occasion, felt his pulse, made a
significant gesture as if to say that all was over,
and went out. One of the prisoners suggested
that the eyes should be closed, which was done
by one of the others, who also, seeing the cross
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
lying on the pillow, took it up, looked at it, and
put it around Mikhailof’s neck; then he crossed
himself. The face was already growing rigid, the
mouth was half open, showing the handsome
white teeth under the thin lips, which closely
adhered to the gums. Finally, the second officer
of the guard appeared in full uniform and helmet,
followed by two soldiers. He slowly advanced,
looking hesitatingly at the solemn circle of prisoners
standing about him. When he drew near
the body, he stopped short as if nailed to the
spot. The spectacle of this wasted, naked form
in irons evidently shocked him. He unfastened
his helmet, took it off, which no one expected of
him, and crossed himself reverentially. He was a
gray-haired veteran officer, and a severe disciplinarian.
One of the soldiers with him seemed
much affected, and, pointing to the corpse, murmured
as he left: ‘He, too, once had a mother!’
These words, I remember, shot through me like
an arrow…. They carried away the corpse,
with the camp bed it lay upon; the straw
rustled, the chains dragged clanking against the
floor, breaking the general silence. We heard
the second officer in the corridor sending some
one for the blacksmith. The corpse must be
unfettered….”</p>

<p>This gives an example of Dostoyevski’s method,
showing his persistence in giving all the minutiæ
of every action. He shows us, how, sometimes,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
among these tragic scenes, kind souls come to
bring consolation to the exiles, as in the case of
a widow who came daily to bring little gifts or a
bit of news, or at least to smile upon the
wretched creatures. “She could give but little,
for she was very poor; but we prisoners felt that
we had at least, close by the walls of our prison,
one being wholly devoted to us,—and that was
something.”</p>

<p>On opening this book, the key-note from the
very beginning has a tone so melancholy, so
harrowing, that you wonder how long the author
can continue in this vein, and how he can ever
manage the gradation into another. But he is
successful in this, as those will see who have the
courage to go on as far as the chapter on corporal
punishments, and the description of the hospital,
to which the prisoners afterwards come to recover
from the effects of these chastisements. It is
impossible to conceive of sufferings more horrible
than these, or more graphically portrayed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dostoyevski does not properly belong
to the “natural school.” The difference is not
easily explained, but there is a difference. Everything
depends upon the master’s intention, which
never deceives the reader. When the realistic
writer only seeks to awake a morbid curiosity, we
inwardly condemn him; but when it is evident
that he is aiming to develop some moral idea, or
impress a lesson the more strongly upon our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
minds, we may criticize the method, but we must
sympathize with the author. His portrayals, even
when disgusting to us, are ennobled, like the
loathsome wound under the hands of the gentle
Sister of Charity. This is the case with Dostoyevski.
His object in writing was reform. With
a cautious but pitiless hand, he has torn away
the curtain which concealed this distant Siberian
hell from the eyes of the Russians themselves.
The “Recollections of a Dead House” gave the
death-blow to the sentence of exile, as “Annals of
a Sportsman” gave the signal for the abolition of
serfdom. To-day I am thankful to say these
repulsive scenes belong only to the history of the
past; corporal punishment has been abolished, and
the prisons in Siberia are regulated with as much
humanity as with us. We can then pardon the
tortures this author has inflicted upon us in his
graphic recitals of these scenes of martyrdom.
We must persevere and continue to the end, and
we shall realize better than from a host of philosophical
dissertations what things are possible in
such a country, what has taken place there so
recently, and how this writer could calmly relate
such horrors without a single expression of revolt
or astonishment. This reserved impartiality is, I
know, partly his own peculiar style, and partly
the result of the severe press-censure; but the
fact that the writer can speak of these horrors as
natural phenomena of social life, reminds us that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
we are looking into a different world from ours,
and must be prepared for all extremes of evil and
good, barbarism, courage, and sacrifice. Those
men who carried the Testament into the prison
with them, those extreme souls are filled with the
spirit of a Gospel which has passed through
Byzantium, written for the ascetic and the martyr;
their errors as well as their virtues are all derived
from that same source. I almost despair of
making this world intelligible to ours, which is
haunted by such different images, moulded by
such different hands.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski has since said, many times, that the
experience in Siberia was beneficial to him, that
he had learned to love his brothers of the lower
classes, and to discover nobleness even among the
very worst criminals. “Destiny,” he said, “in
treating me with the severity of a step-mother,
became a true mother to me.”</p>

<p>The last chapter of this work might be entitled:
“A Resurrection.” In it are described, with rare
skill, the sentiments of a prisoner as he approaches
the time of his liberation. During the last few
weeks, his hero has the privilege of obtaining a
few books, and occasionally an odd number of a
review. For ten years he had read nothing but
his Gospel, had heard nothing of the outside
world.</p>

<p>In taking up the thread of life among his contemporaries,
he experiences unusual sensations;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
he enters into a new universe; he cannot explain
many simple words and events; he asks himself,
almost with terror, what giant strides his generation
has made without him; these feelings must
resemble those of a man who has been resuscitated.</p>

<p>At last the solemn hour has come. He tenderly
bids his companions farewell, feeling real regret
at parting with them; he leaves a portion of his
heart wherever he goes, even in a prison. He goes
to the forge, his fetters fall, he is a free man!</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The freedom which Dostoyevski entered into
was, however, only a relative one. He entered a
Siberian regiment as a common soldier. The new
reign, two years after, in 1856, brought him pardon.
At first he was promoted to the rank of officer, and
his civil rights restored to him, and then authorized
to send in his resignation. But it was a long time
before he could obtain permission to leave the
country, or to publish anything. At last, in 1859,
after ten years of exile, he recrossed the Ural mountains
and returned to a country which he found
greatly changed, and at that moment palpitating
with impatience and hope, on the eve of the Emancipation.
He brought a companion with him from
Siberia, the widow of one of his old comrades in the
conspiracy of Petrachevski, whom he there met,
fell in love with, and married. But, as in every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
phase of his life, this romantic marriage too was
destined to be crossed by misfortune and ennobled
by self-sacrifice. The young wife conceived a
stronger attachment for another man, whom she
threatened to join. For a whole year Dostoyevski’s
letters prove that he was working to secure the
happiness of his wife and his rival, writing constantly
to his friends at St. Petersburg to help him
to remove all obstacles to their union. “As for
me,” he added, at the close of one of those letters,
“God knows what I shall do! I shall either
drown myself or take to drinking.”</p>

<p>It was this page of his personal history which
he reproduced in “The Degraded and Insulted,”
the first of his romances which was translated into
French, but not the best. The position of the
confidant favoring a love affair which only
brought despair for himself, was true to nature,
for it was his own experience. Whether it was
not skilfully presented, or whether we ourselves
are more selfish by nature, I cannot say, but it is
hard for us to accept such a situation, or not to
see a ridiculous side to it. The general public
cannot appreciate such subtleties. His characters
are too melodramatic. On the very rare occasions
when he draws his types from the upper classes,
he always makes a failure, for he understands
nothing of the complex and restrained passions of
souls hardened by intercourse with the world.
Natasha’s lover, the giddy creature for whom she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
has sacrificed everything, is not much better. I
know that we must not expect lovers to be reasonable
beings, and that it is more philosophical to admire
the power of love, irrespectively of its object;
but the general novel-reader is not supposed to be
a philosopher; he would like the adored hero to
be interesting at least, and would prefer even a
rascal to an idiot. In France, at all events, we
cannot endorse such a spectacle, although it is both
true to nature and consoling; an exquisite type of
woman devoted to a fool. Our gallantry, however,
forces us to admit that a man of genius may be permitted
to adore a foolish woman, but that is all we
are willing to concede. Dostoyevski himself has
surpassed the most severe criticisms of this work
in his article on the “Degraded and Insulted”:
“I realize that many of the characters in my book
are puppets rather than men.”</p>

<p>With these exceptions, we must acknowledge
that we recognize the hand of a master in the two
female characters. Natasha is the very incarnation
of intense, jealous passion; she speaks and
acts like a victim of love in a Greek tragedy.
Nelly, a charming and pathetic little creature,
resembles one of Dickens’ beautiful child characters.</p>

<p>After his return to St. Petersburg, in 1865,
Dostoyevski became absorbed in journalism. He
conceived an unfortunate passion for this form of
literature, and devoted to it the best years of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
life. He edited two journals to defend the ideas
which he had adopted. I defy any one to express
these ideas in any practical language. He took a
position between the liberal and the <dfn>Slavophile</dfn>
parties, inclining more toward the latter. It was
a patriotic form of religion, but somewhat mysterious,
with no precise dogmas, and lending itself to
no rational explanation. One must either accept
or reject it altogether. The great error of the
<dfn>Slavophile</dfn> party has been to have filled so many
pages of paper for twenty-five years, in arguing
out a mere sentiment. Whoever questions their
arguments is considered incapable of understanding
them; while those who do not enter into the
question at all are despised, and taxed with profound
ignorance.</p>

<p>At this time of transition, during the first
years following the Emancipation, men’s ideas, too
long repressed, were in a state of vertigo, of
chaotic confusion. Some were buoyed up with
the wildest hopes; others felt the bitterness of
disenchantment, and many disappointed enthusiasts
embraced Nihilism, which was taken up at
this time by romance writers as well as by politicians.
Dostoyevski abandoned his purely artistic
ideals, withdrew from the influence of Gogol, and
consecrated himself to the study of this new
doctrine.</p>

<p>From 1865, our author experienced a series of
unfortunate years. His second journal was unsuccessful,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
failed, and he was crushed under the
burden of heavy debts incurred in the enterprise.
He afterwards lost his wife, as related above, and
also his brother Alexis, his associate in his literary
labors. He fled to escape his creditors, and
dragged out a miserable existence in Germany
and Italy. Attacks of epilepsy interrupted his
work, and he only returned home from time to
time to solicit advance pay from his editors. All
that he saw in his travels seems to have made
no impression upon him, with the exception of
an execution he witnessed at Lyons. This spectacle
was retained in his memory, to be described
in detail by characters of his future romances.</p>

<p>In spite of his illness and other troubles, he
wrote at this time three of his longest novels,—“Crime
et Châtiment,” “l’Idiot,” and “Les
Possédés.” “Crime and Punishment” was
written when he was at the height of his powers.
It has been translated, and can therefore be
criticised. Men of science who enjoy the study of
the human soul, will read with interest the profoundest
psychological study which has been
written since Macbeth. The curious of a certain
type will find in this book the entertaining mode
of torture which is to their taste; but I think it
will terrify the greater number of readers, and
that very many will have no desire to finish it.
We generally read a novel for pleasure, and not
for punishment. This book has a powerful effect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
upon women, and upon all impressionable natures.
The writer’s graphic scenes of terror are too
much for a nervous organization. I have myself
seen in Russia numerous examples of the infallible
effect of this romance upon the mind. It can
be urged that the Slav temperament is unusually
susceptible, but I have seen the same impression
made upon Frenchmen. Hoffmann, Edgar Poe,
Baudelaire, all writers of this type, are mere
mystics in comparison with Dostoyevski. In
their fictions you feel that they are only pursuing
a literary or artistic venture; but in “Crime and
Punishment,” you are impressed with the fact
that the author is as much horrified as you are
yourself by the character that he has drawn from
the tissue of his own brain.</p>

<p>The subject is very simple. A man conceives
the idea of committing a crime; he matures it,
commits the deed, defends himself for some time
from being arrested, and finally gives himself up
to the expiation of it. For once, this Russian
artist has adopted the European idea of unity of
action; the drama, purely psychological, is made
up of the combat between the man and his own
project. The accessory characters and facts are
of no consequence, except in regard to their influence
upon the criminal’s plans. The first part,
in which are described the birth and growth of
the criminal idea, is written with consummate
skill and a truth and subtlety of analysis beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
all praise. The student Raskolnikof, a
nihilist in the true sense of the word, intelligent,
unprincipled, unscrupulous, reduced to extreme
poverty, dreams of a happier condition.
On returning home from going to pawn a jewel
at an old pawnbroker’s shop, this vague thought
crosses his brain without his attaching much
importance to <span class="lock">it:—</span></p>

<p>“An intelligent man who had that old woman’s
money could accomplish anything he liked; it is
only necessary to get rid of the useless, hateful
old hag.”</p>

<p>This was but one of those fleeting thoughts
which cross the brain like a nightmare, and which
only assume a distinct form through the assent of
the will. This idea becomes fixed in the man’s
brain, growing and increasing on every page, until
he is perfectly possessed by it. Every hard experience
of his outward life appears to him to
bear some relation to his project; and by a mysterious
power of reasoning, to work into his plan
and urge him on to the crime. The influence
exercised upon this man is brought out into
such distinct relief that it seems to us itself
like a living actor in the drama, guiding the
criminal’s hand to the murderous weapon. The
horrible deed is accomplished; and the unfortunate
man wrestles with the recollection of it as he did
with the original design. The relations of the
world to the murderer are all changed, through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
the irreparable fact of his having suppressed a
human life. Everything takes on a new physiognomy
and a new meaning to him, excluding from
him the possibility of feeling and reasoning like
other people, or of finding his own place in life.
His whole soul is metamorphosed and in constant
discord with the life around him. This is not
remorse in the true sense of the word. Dostoyevski
exerts himself to distinguish and explain the
difference. His hero will feel no remorse until
the day of expiation; but it is a complex and perverse
feeling which possesses him; the vexation
at having derived no satisfaction from an act so
successfully carried out; the revolting against
the unexpected moral consequences of that act;
the shame of finding himself so weak and helpless;
for the foundation of Raskolnikof’s character is
pride. Only one single interest in life is left to
him: to deceive and elude the police. He seeks
their company, their friendship, by an attraction
analogous to that which draws us to the extreme
edge of a dizzy precipice; the murderer keeps up
interminable interviews with his friends at the
police office, and even leads on the conversation
to that point, when a single word would betray
him; every moment we fear he will utter the
word; but he escapes and continues the terrible
game as if it were a pleasure.</p>

<p>The magistrate Porphyre has guessed the
student’s secret; he plays with him like a tiger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
with its prey, sure of his game. Then Raskolnikof
knows he is discovered; and through several
chapters a long fantastic dialogue is kept up between
the two adversaries; a double dialogue,
that of the lips, which smile and wilfully ignore;
and that of the eyes which know and betray all.
At last when the author has tortured us sufficiently
in this way, he introduces the salutary influence
which is to break down the culprit’s pride
and reconcile him to the expiation of his crime.
Raskolnikof loves a poor street-walker. The
author’s clairvoyance divines that even the sentiment
of love was destined in him to be modified,
like every other, to be changed into a dull despair.</p>

<p>Sonia is a humble creature, who has sold herself
to escape starvation, and is almost unconscious
of her dishonor, enduring it as a malady she cannot
prevent. She wears her ignominy as a cross, with
pious resignation. She is attached to the only
man who has not treated her with contempt; she
sees that he is tortured by some secret, and tries
to draw it from him. After a long struggle the
avowal is made, but not in words. In a mute
interview, which is tragic in the extreme, Sonia
reads the terrible truth in her friend’s eyes. The
poor girl is stunned for a moment, but recovers
herself quickly. She knows the remedy; her
stricken heart cries <span class="lock">out:—</span></p>

<p>“We must suffer, and suffer together … we
must pray and atone … let us go to prison!…”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Thus are we led back to Dostoyevski’s favorite
idea, to the Russian’s fundamental conception of
Christianity: the efficacy of atonement, of suffering,
and its being the only solution of all difficulties.</p>

<p>To express the singular relations between these
two beings, that solemn, pathetic bond, so foreign
to every pre-conceived idea of love, we should
make use of the word <em>compassion</em> in the sense in
which Bossuet used it: the suffering with and
through another being. When Raskolnikof falls
at the feet of the girl who supports her parents
by her shame, she, the despised of all, is terrified
at his self-abasement, and begs him to rise. He
then utters a phrase which expresses the combination
of all the books we are studying: “It is
not only before thee that I prostrate myself, but
before all suffering humanity.” Let us here observe
that our author has never yet once succeeded
in representing love in any form apart
from these subtleties, or the simple natural
attraction of two hearts toward each other. He
portrays only extreme cases; either that mystic
state of sympathy and self-sacrifice for a distressed
fellow-creature, of utter devotion, apart
from any selfish desire: or the mad, bestial cruelty
of a perverted nature. The lovers he represents
are not made of flesh and blood, but of nerves
and tears. Yet this realist evokes only harrowing
<em>thoughts</em>, never disagreeable <em>images</em>. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
defy any one to quote a single line suggestive of
anything sensual, or a single instance where the
woman is represented in the light of a temptress.
His love scenes are absolutely chaste, and yet he
seems to be incapable of portraying any creation
between an angel and a beast.</p>

<p>You can imagine what the <i lang="fr">dénouement</i> will be.
The nihilist, half conquered, prowls for some time
around the police office; and finally he acknowledges
his guilt, and is condemned. Sonia teaches
him to pray, and the wretched creatures go to
Siberia. Dostoyevski gladly seizes the opportunity
to rewrite, as a sort of epilogue, a chapter
of his “Recollections of a Dead House.”</p>

<p>Apart from the principal characters of this
book, there are secondary characters and scenes
which are impossible to forget, such is the impression
they leave upon you after one reading.
There is one scene where the murderer, always
mysteriously attracted back to the fatal spot, tries
to recall every detail of his crime; he even goes
to pull the cracked bell of the apartment, in order
to recall more vividly by this sound the impression
of the terrible moment. Detached fragments of
this work seem to lose their signification, and if
you skip a few pages the whole thing becomes
unintelligible. One may feel impatient with the
author’s prolixity, but if he omits anything the
magnetic current is interrupted. This I have
been told by those who have tried the experiment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
The reader requires as much of an effort
of concentration and memory as for a philosophical
treatise. This is a pleasure or a penalty
according to the reader. Besides, a translation,
however good, cannot possibly render the continuous
smooth course of the original text, or give
its under-currents of meaning.</p>

<p>We cannot but pity the man who has written
such a book, so evidently drawn from the substance
of his own brain. To understand how he
was led so to write, we must note what he once
said to a friend in regard to his mental condition,
after one of his severe attacks of illness:—“The
state of dejection into which they plunge me
makes me feel in this way: I seem to be like
a criminal who has committed some terrible deed
which weighs upon his conscience.” The review
which published Dostoyevski’s novels often gave
but a few pages at a time, followed by a brief
note of apology. Every one understood that
Feodor Mikhailovitch had had one of his severe
attacks of illness.</p>

<p>“Crime and Punishment” established the
author’s popularity. Its appearance was the great
literary event of the year 1866. All Russia was
made ill by it, so to speak. When the book first
appeared, a Moscow student murdered a pawnbroker
in almost precisely the way described by
the novelist; and I firmly believe that many subsequent
attempts, analogous to this, may have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
been attributable to the influence of this book.
Dostoyevski’s intention, of course, was undoubtedly
to dissuade men from such acts by representing
their terrible consequences; but he did
not foresee that the intensity of his portrayals
might act in an opposite sense, and tempt the
demon of imitation existing in a certain type of
brain. I therefore hesitate to pronounce upon the
moral value of the work. Our writers may say
that I am over-scrupulous. They may not admit
that the moral value of a work of art is a thing
to be taken into account in regard to the appreciation
of it as a work of art. But does anything
exist in this world wholly independent of a moral
value?</p>

<p>The Russian authors claim that they aim to
nourish souls, and the greatest offence you could
offer them would be to accuse them of making
a collection of purposeless words. Dostoyevski’s
novels will be judged either as useful or harmful
according as one decides for or against the
morality of public executions and sentences. It
is an open question. For myself, I should decide
against them.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>In this work Dostoyevski’s talent had reached
its culminating point. In “The Idiot,” “The
Possessed,” and especially in “The Karamazof
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
Brothers,” many parts are intolerably tedious.
The plot amounts to nothing but a framework
upon which to hang all the author’s favorite
theories, and display every type of his eccentric
fancy. The book is nearly filled with conversations
between two disputants, whose ideas are
continually clashing, each trying to worm out the
other’s secrets with the most cunning art, and
expose some secret intrigue either of crime or of
love. These interviews recall the terrible trials
under Ivan the Terrible, or Peter the First; there
is the same combination of terror, duplicity, and
obstinacy still existing in the race. Sometimes
the disputants attempt to penetrate the labyrinth
of each other’s religious or philosophical beliefs.
They vie with each other in the use of arguments,
now fine-spun, now eccentric, like a pair of
scholastic doctors of the Sorbonne. Some of
these conversations recall Hamlet’s dialogues with
his mother, Ophelia, or Polonius. For more than
two hundred years critics have discussed the
question whether Hamlet was mad when he thus
spoke. When that question has been settled, the
decision may be applied to Dostoyevski’s heroes.
It has been said more than once that this writer
and the heroes of his creation are simply madmen.
They are mad in the same degree that Hamlet
was. For my own part, I consider this statement
neither an intelligent nor reasonable one. Such
an opinion must be held only by those very short-sighted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
people who refuse to admit the existence
of states of mind different from those they know
from personal experience.</p>

<p>In studying Dostoyevski and his work, we must
keep in mind one of his favorite phrases, which he
often repeats: “Russia is a freak of nature.”
A strange anomaly exists in some of these lunatics
he describes. They are absorbed in the contemplation
of their own minds, intent upon self-analysis.
If the author leads them into action,
they throw themselves into it impetuously, obedient
to the irregular impulses of their nerves,
giving free rein to their unbridled wills, which are
uncontrollable as are elementary forces. Observe
how minutely he describes every physical peculiarity.
The condition of the body explains the
perturbation of the soul. Whenever a character is
introduced to us, he is never by any chance sitting
comfortably by a table or engaged in any occupation.
“He was extended upon a divan, with
his eyes closed, although he was not asleep….
He walked along the street without having any
idea where he was…. He was motionless,
his eyes absently fixed upon space.”…</p>

<p>These people never eat; they drink tea through
the night. Many are given to strong drink.
They rarely sleep, and when they do they dream.
There are more dreams described in Dostoyevski’s
works than in the whole of our classic literature.
They are nearly always in a “feverish condition.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
Whenever any of these creatures come into relations
with their fellow-beings, you meet with such
expression as these in almost every line:—“He
shuddered … he sprang up with a bound …
his features contracted … he became ashy pale
… his lower lip trembled … his teeth chattered….”
Sometimes there are long pauses in
a conversation, when the disputants look fixedly
into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>The writer’s most elaborate creation, and evidently
his favorite one, the analysis of which fills
a large volume, is “The Idiot.” Feodor Mikhailovitch
has described himself in this character,
in the way that many authors do: certainly not as
he was, but what he wished to be considered. In
the first place, “The Idiot” is subject to epilepsy;
his attacks furnish a most convenient and effective
climax for all emotional scenes. The author
evidently greatly enjoys describing these; he
assures us that the whole being is bathed in an
ecstasy, for a few seconds preceding the attack.
We are quite willing to take his word for this.
The nickname “Idiot” becomes fixed upon the
hero, Prince Myshkin, because his malady produced
such an effect upon his faculties in childhood
that he has always been eccentric. Starting
with this pathological idea, this fictitious character
is persistently developed with an astonishing consistency.</p>

<p>Dostoyevski at first had the idea of producing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
another Don Quixote, the ideal redresser of
wrongs. Occasionally you feel the impress of this
idea; but soon the author is carried away by his
own creation; his aim is loftier, he creates in the
soul in which he sees himself mirrored the most
sublime, Christ-like qualities, he makes a desperate
effort to elevate the character to the moral
proportions of a saint. Imagine, if you can, an exceptional
being, possessing the mind and reasoning
faculties of a man, while his heart retains the simplicity
of a child, who, in short, can personify the
gospel precept: “Be as little children.” Such a
character is Prince Myshkin, the “Idiot.” The
nervous disease has, by a happy chance, produced
this phenomenon; it has destroyed that part of
the intellect which is the seat of all our defects:
irony, arrogance, selfishness, avarice; while the
noble qualities are largely developed. On leaving
the hospital, this extraordinary young man is
thrown into the current of ordinary life. It would
seem that he must perish in such an atmosphere,
not having the weapons of defence that others are
armed with. Not so; his simple straightforwardness
is stronger than any of the malicious tricks
practised upon him; it carries him through every
difficulty, saves him from every snare. His innocent
wisdom has the last word in all discussions;
he utters phrases proceeding from a profound
asceticism, such as this, addressed to a dying man:—“Pass
on before us, and forgive us our happiness.”—Elsewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
he says: “I fear I am unworthy
of my sufferings—” and many similar
expressions. He lives among a set of usurers,
liars, and rascals. These people treat him as they
would an idiot, but respect and venerate him;
they feel his influence, and become better men.
The women also laugh at the idiot at first, but
they all end by falling desperately in love with
him; while he responds to their adoration only by
a tender pity, a compassionate love, the only sort
that Dostoyevski permits his favorite characters
to indulge in.</p>

<p>The writer constantly returns to his ruling
idea, the supremacy of the suffering and poor in
spirit. Why do all the Russian idealists, without
exception, cry out against prosperity in life?
What I believe to be the secret, unconscious solution
of this unreasonable feeling is this: they feel
the force of that fundamental truth, that the life
of a living, acting, thinking being must perforce
be a mixture of good and evil. Whoever acts,
creates and destroys at the same time, makes for
himself a place in the world at the expense of
some other person or thing. Therefore, if one
neither acts nor thinks, this fatality must naturally
be suppressed,—this production of evil as well as
of good; and, as the evil he does has more effect
than the good, he takes refuge in a non-existence.
So these writers admire and sanctify the idiot,—the
neutral, inactive being. It is true, he does no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
good, but then he can do no evil: therefore,
from the point of view of pessimists, in their
conception of the world, he is the most admirable.</p>

<p>As I read, I am overwhelmed by the number of
these moral giants and monsters around me; but
I cannot pass by one of the most striking of them,
Rogozhin, the merchant, a very forcibly drawn figure.
The twenty pages descriptive of the workings
of passion in the heart of this man are written
by the hand of a great master. Passion, in this
strange nature, has developed to such intensity,
and bestows upon the man such a gift of fascination,
that the woman he loves accepts, in spite of
herself, this savage whom she abhors, and moreover
with the certainty that he will murder her.
So he does; and, throughout an entire night,
beside the bed where lies the body of his strangled
victim, he calmly discusses philosophy with his
friend. There is nothing melodramatic about this
scene. It is simple as possible; to the author, at
least, it appears quite natural; and this is why it
makes us shiver with terror. I must also mention,—there
are so few such touches in the work—the
little drunken money-lender who “offers a prayer
every night for the repose of the soul of Mme. du
Barry.” Do not suppose that Dostoyevski means
to enliven us with anything approaching a joke.
Through the lips of this character, he seriously
indulges in compassionate sympathy for the martyrdom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">endured by Mme. du Barry during the</span><br>
long passage of the cart through the streets and
the struggle with the executioner. He evidently
has always before him that half-hour of the 22d
December, 1849.</p>

<p>“Les Possédés” is a description of the revolutionary
world of the Nihilists. This title is a
slight modification of the Russian title, “The
Demons,” which is too obscure. All Dostoyevski’s
characters might be said to be <em>possessed</em>, as
the word was understood in the Middle Ages. A
strange, irresistible will urges them on, in spite of
themselves, to commit atrocious deeds. Natasha,
in “The Degraded and Insulted,” is an example;
as also Raskolnikof, in “Crime and Punishment,”
and Rogozhin, in “The Idiot,” besides all the conspirators
who commit murder or suicide without
any definite aim or motive. The history of the origin
of “Les Possédés” is rather curious. Dostoyevski
was always opposed to Turgenef in politics
and even more seriously through literary jealousy.
At this time, Tolstoï had not yet established his
reputation; and the other two were the only competitors
in the field ready to dispute empire over the
imaginations of their countrymen. The inevitable
rivalry between them amounted, on Dostoyevski’s
part, to hatred. He was always the wronged
party; and into this volume he most unjustifiably
introduced his brother author under the
guise of a ridiculous actor. But his secret, unpardonable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
grievance was that Turgenef was the
first to take up and treat the subject of Nihilism,
introducing it into his celebrated novel, “Fathers
and Sons.” Since 1861 Nihilism had, however,
developed from a metaphysical doctrine into practical
action. Dostoyevski wrote “Les Possédés”
out of revenge; three years after, Turgenef accepted
the challenge, by publishing “Virgin
Soil.” The theme of both romances is the
same—a revolutionary conspiracy in a small
provincial town.</p>

<p>The prize in this tilting match must be adjudged
to the dramatic psychologist rather than
to the gentle artist who created “Virgin Soil.”
Dostoyevski lays bare the inmost recesses of
those intricate natures more completely; the
scene of Shatof’s murder is rendered with a diabolical
power which Turgenef was utterly incapable
of. Still, it must be admitted that Bazarof,
the cynic in “Fathers and Sons,” was the imperishable
prototype of all Nihilists who came after
him. Dostoyevski felt this, and keenly regretted
it. His book, however, may be called a prophecy
as well as an explanation. It was truly prophetic;
for in 1871, when anarchy was still in
the process of fermentation, he looked deeply
enough into the future to relate facts precisely
analogous to what we have since seen developed.
I attended the trials of the Nihilists and can testify
that many of the men and the conspiracies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
that were judged at that time were exact reproductions
of those the novelist had previously
created.</p>

<p>The book is also an explanation; for the world
will understand from it the true face of the problem,
which is even to-day imperfectly understood,
because its solution is sought only in politics.
Dostoyevski presents to us the various classes of
minds from which the sect is recruited. First,
the simple unbeliever, who devotes all his capacity
for religious fervor to the service of
atheism.—The author illustrates this type by
the following anecdote (in every Russian’s
bedroom stands a little altar, with its holy
images of the saints): “Lieutenant Erkel, having
thrown down the images and broken them in
pieces with an axe, arranged upon the tablets
three atheistic books; then he lighted some
church tapers and placed one before each volume.”—Secondly,
there is the weak class, who
feel the magnetism of the strong, and blindly follow
their chiefs. Then the logical pessimists,
among whom the engineer Kirilof is an example.
These are inclined toward suicide, through moral
inability to live. Their party takes advantage of
these yielding natures; for a man without principles,
who decides to die because he can settle
upon no principles, is one who will easily lend
himself to whatever is exacted of him. Finally,
the worst class: those who will not hesitate to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
commit murder, as a protest against the order of
the world, which they do not comprehend, and in
order to make a singular and novel use of their
will power, to enjoy inspiring terror in others,
and satisfy the animal cravings within them.</p>

<p>The greatest merit of this confusing book,
which is badly constructed, often ridiculous, and
loaded with doubtful theories, is that it gives us,
after all, a clear idea of what constitutes the real
power of the Nihilists. This does not lie in the
doctrines in themselves, nor in the power of
organization of this sect, which is certainly overrated;
it lies simply and only in the character of
a few men. Dostoyevski thinks, and the revelations
brought to light in the trials have justified
his opinion, that the famous organization may be
reduced to only a few local circles, badly organized;
and that all these phantoms, central committees
and executive committees, exist only in
the imaginations of the adepts. On the other
hand, he brings into bold relief those iron wills,
those souls of frozen steel, in striking contrast
with the timidity and irresolution of the legal
authorities. Between these two poles he shows
us the mass of weak natures, attracted toward
that pole which is most strongly magnetized. It
is, indeed, the force of character of these resolute
men, and not their ideas, which has acted upon the
Russian people; and here the piercing eye of the
philosopher is keener than that of Russia herself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Men become less and less exacting in regard to
ideas, and more and more skeptical as to the way
of carrying them out. Those who believe in the
absolute virtue of doctrines are becoming every
day more rare; but what is seductive to them is
force of character, even if its energy be applied to
an evil cause,—because it promises to be a guide,
and guarantees a strong leadership, the very first
requisition of any association of men. Man is
the born slave of every strong will which he
comes in contact with.</p>

<p>The last period of Dostoyevski’s life, after the
publication of this book, and his return to Russia,
was somewhat easier and less melancholy. He
had married an intelligent and courageous woman,
who helped him out of his pecuniary embarrassments.
His popularity increased, while the success
of his books freed him from debt. Taking up
journalism again, he established a paper in St.
Petersburg, and finally an organ peculiarly his
own, which he conducted quite by himself. It
was called the “Note-book of an Author” (Carnet
d’un Ecrivain), and it appeared—whenever
he chose. It did not at all resemble what we call
a journal or review, but might have been called
something similar to the Delphic oracle. Into
this encyclopædia, the principal work of his latter
years, he poured all the political, social, and literary
ideas which beset him, and related anecdotes
and reminiscences of his life. I have already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
stated what his politics were; but the obscure
productions of this period can neither be analyzed
nor controverted. This periodical, which first appeared
just before the war with Turkey, reflected
the states of enthusiasm and discouragement of
Russia through those years of feverish patriotism.
Everything could be found in this summary of
dreams, in which every question relating to human
life was mooted. Only one thing was wanting: a
solid basis of doctrine that the mind could take
hold of. There were occasionally some touching
episodes and artistic bits of composition recalling
the great novelist. The “Note-book of an
Author” was in fact a success, although the public
now really cared less for the ideas than for the
person, and were, besides, so accustomed to and
fond of the sound of his voice. His last book,
“The Karamazof Brothers,” was so interminably
long that very few Russians had patience to read
it to the end. But it contains some scenes equal
to his best of early days, especially that of the
death of the child. The French novel grows ever
smaller, is easily slipped into a travelling-bag, to
while away a few hours on a journey; but the
heavy Russian romance reigns long upon the
family table in country homes, through the long
winter evenings. I well remember seeing Dostoyevski
entering a friend’s house, on the day his last
novel appeared, with the heavy volumes under
his arm; and his saying with pride: “They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
weigh, at least, five pounds”;—a fact he should
rather have regretted than have taken pride in.</p>

<p>I should say here that the three books which
best show the different phases of his talent are:
“Poor People,” “Recollections of a Dead House,”
and “Crime and Punishment.” As to the criticism
of his works as a whole, every one will have
to use his own judgment. We must look upon
Dostoyevski as a phenomenon of another world,
an abnormal and mighty monster, quite unique
as to originality and intensity. In spite of his
genius, you feel that he lacks both moderation and
breadth. The world is not composed of shadows
and tears alone. Even in Russia there is light
and gayety, there are flowers and pleasures.
Dostoyevski has never seen but one half of life;
for he has never written any books except either
sad or terrible ones. He is like a traveller who
has seen the whole universe, and described what
he has seen, but who has never travelled except by
night. He is an incomparable psychologist when
he studies souls either blackened by crime or
wounded by sorrow; and as skilful a dramatist,
but limited to scenes of terror and of misery. No
one has carried realism to such an extreme point
as he. He depicts real life, but soars above reality
in a superhuman effort toward some new consummation
of the Gospel. He possesses a double
nature, from whatever side you view him: the
heart of a Sister of Charity and the spirit of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
Grand Inquisitor. I think of him as belonging to
another age, to the time of great sacrifices and
intense devotion, hesitating between a St. Vincent
de Paul and a Laubardemont, preceding the first
in his search for destitute children, lingering behind
the other, unwilling to lose the last crackling
of the funeral pile.</p>

<p>According as we are affected by particular examples
of his talent, we call him a philosopher,
an apostle, a lunatic, a consoler of the afflicted, or
the torturer of a tranquil mind; the Jeremiah of
the prison or the Shakespeare of the mad-house.
Every one of these appellations belongs to him;
but no one of them, taken alone, will suffice.
What he himself said of his race, in “Crime and
Punishment,” we may say of <span class="lock">him:—</span></p>

<p>“The soul of the Russian is great, like his vast
country; but terribly prone to everything fantastic
and excessive; it is a real misfortune to be
great without any special genius.”</p>

<p>I subscribe to this; but also to the opinion that
I have heard expressed upon this book by one of
our masters of psychology: “This author opens
up unknown horizons, and discloses souls different
from ours; he reveals to us a new world of
beings, with stronger natures, both for good and
evil, having stronger wills and greater endurance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>

<h4>
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>I must apologize for returning to personal
recollections in order to make this sketch complete,
and must therefore recall the man himself,
and give some idea of his extraordinary influence.
By chance I met Feodor Mikhailovitch many times
during the last three years of his life. The impression
he made upon you was as profound as was
that of the most striking scenes of his romances;
if you had once seen him, you would never forget
him. His appearance exactly corresponded with
his life and its work. He was short and spare,
and seemed to be all nerves; worn and haggard
at the age of sixty. He was, in fact, prematurely
old, and looked ill, with his long beard and blond
hair, but, in spite of all, as vivacious as ever.
His face was of the true peasant type of Moscow:
the flat nose; the small, twinkling eyes, full of
fire and tenderness; the broad forehead, all
seamed with wrinkles, and with many indentations
and protuberances; the sunken temples,
and, most noticeable of all, a mouth of inexpressible
sadness. I never saw in any human face
such an expression of accumulated sorrow—as if
every trial of soul and body had left its imprint
upon it. You could read in his face better than
in any book his recollections of the dead house,
and his long experience of terror, mistrust, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
martyrdom. His eyelids, lips, and every fibre of
his face quivered with nervous contractions. His
features would grow fierce with anger when excited
over some subject of discussion, and at
another time would wear the gentle expression
of sadness you so often see in the saints on the
ancient Slavonic altar-pieces, so venerated by the
Slav nation. The man’s nature was wholly plebeian,
with the curious mixture of roughness,
sagacity, and mildness of the Russian peasant,
together with something incongruous—possibly
an effect of the concentration of thought illumining
this beggar’s mask. At first he rather repelled
you, before his strange magnetism had begun to
act upon you. He was generally taciturn, but
when he spoke it was in a low tone, slow and
deliberate, growing gradually more earnest, and
defending his opinions without regard to any one.
While sustaining his favorite theme of the superiority
of the Russian lower classes, he often
observed to ladies in the fashionable society he
was drawn into, “You cannot pretend to compare
with the most inferior peasant.”</p>

<p>There was not much opportunity for literary
discussion with Dostoyevski. He would stop you
with one word of proud disdain. “We possess
the best qualities of every other people, and our
own peculiar ones in addition; therefore we can
understand you, but you are not capable of understanding
us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
May I be forgiven, but I shall now attempt to
prove the contrary. In spite of his assertion, his
views on European life were laughably ingenuous.
I remember well one of his tirades against
the city of Paris, one evening when the inspiration
seized him. He spoke of it with fiery indignation,
as Jonah would have spoken concerning
Nineveh. I remember the very <span class="lock">words:—</span></p>

<p>“Some night a prophet will appear in the ‘Café
Anglais’! He will write on the wall the three
words of fire; that will be the signal for the end
of the old world, and Paris will be destroyed in
fire and blood, in all its pride, with its theatres
and its ‘Café Anglais.’” In the seer’s imagination,
this inoffensive establishment represented
the heart of Sodom, a den of enticing and infernal
orgies, which he thought it his duty to
call down curses upon. He enlarged long and
eloquently upon this theme.</p>

<p>He often reminded me of J. J. Rousseau. That
pedantic genius has often come before me since I
have studied the character and works of this distrustful
philanthropist of Moscow. Both entertained
the same notions, had the same combination
of roughness and ideality, of sensibility and
ill-humor, as well as the same deep sympathy for
humanity which compels the attention of their
contemporaries. After Rousseau, no man had
greater literary defects than Dostoyevski: boundless
self-love, over-sensitiveness, jealousy, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
spite, none knew better how to win the hearts of
his fellow-men by showing them how they filled
his heart. This writer, so forbidding in society,
was the idol of a large proportion of the young
men of Russia, who awaited with feverish impatience
the appearance of his novels, as well as his
periodical; who consulted him as they would a
spiritual adviser and director, and sought his help
in all moral questions.</p>

<p>The most important work of the latter years of
his life was to reply to the scores of letters which
brought to him the echo of strangers’ grievances.
One must have lived in Russia during those
troublous times, to understand the ascendancy he
obtained over the world of “Poor People” in
their search for a new ideal, as well as over the
class just above the very poor. The influence of
Turgenef’s literary and artistic work was most
unjustly eclipsed; Tolstoï with his philosophy
influenced only the most intellectual minds, but
Dostoyevski won all hearts and obtained a most
powerful sway over them. In 1880, at the time
of the inauguration of the monument to Pushkin,
when all the Russian authors assembled in full
force to celebrate the fête, Dostoyevski’s popularity
entirely obliterated that of all his rivals. The
audience sobbed when he addressed them. They
bore him in triumph in their arms; the students
crowded upon the platform and took possession
of it, that they might see and be near him and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
touch him; and one of these young enthusiasts
swooned from emotion when he had succeeded in
reaching him. The current of feeling ran so high
that had he lived a few years longer he would
have found himself in a very difficult position.
In the official hierarchy of the empire there is no
place for plants of such exuberant growth; no
field for the influence of a Goethe or a Voltaire.
In spite of his consistency in politics and his perfect
orthodoxy, the old exile would have seriously
risked being compromised by his blind
partisans, and even considered dangerous. They
only realized on the day of his death how dangerous
he was.</p>

<p>Although I regret to finish this sombre sketch
with a funereal scene, I cannot refrain from
speaking of the apotheosis accorded to him, and
the impression it made upon me, for it will show,
more than any extended criticism, what this man
was to his native country. On the 10th of February,
1881, some friends of Dostoyevski told me
that he had died the preceding night, after a short
illness. We went to his house to attend the service
which the Russian Church holds twice a day
over the remains of the dead, from the time of
the decease until the burial. He lived in a populous
quarter of St. Petersburg. We found an
immense crowd before the door and on the staircase,
and with great difficulty threaded our way
to the study, where the great author lay. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
a small apartment, strewn with papers and pamphlets,
and crowded by the visitors, who filed
around the coffin, which rested upon a little table
at one end of the room. I saw that face for the
first time at peace, utterly free from pain. He
seemed to be happily dreaming under the profusion
of roses, which quickly disappeared, divided
among the crowd as relics. The crowd increased
every moment, all the women were in tears, the
men boisterously pushing and crowding, eager to
see his face. The temperature of the room became
suffocating, being closed quite tightly from
the air, as Russian rooms are in winter. Suddenly
the air seemed to be exhausted, all the candles
went out, and only the little flickering lamp
before the holy images remained. Just at this
moment, in the darkness, there was a terrible rush
from the staircase, bringing a new influx of people.
It seemed as if the whole crowd outside
were mounting the stairs; the first comers were
hurled against the coffin, which tottered—the
poor widow, crowded, with her two children,
between the table and the wall, threw herself
over the body of her husband, and held it,
screaming with terror. For a few moments we
thought the corpse would be crushed under foot
by the crowd. It oscillated, pressed upon by this
mass of humanity, by the ardent and brutal
affection of the rushing throngs below. At this
moment there came before me a rapid vision of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
the author’s whole work, with all the cruelty, terror,
and tenderness he tried to portray in it.
This throng of strangers seemed to assume
names and forms quite familiar to me. Fancy
had sketched them in books, but now they stood
living before me, taking part in a similar scene of
horror. His characters seemed to have come to
torment him, even after death, to bring him their
rough homage, even to the profanation of the
object of it. He would have appreciated just
such exaggerated homage.</p>

<p>Two days after, this vision was repeated more
completely, and on a larger scale. The 12th
February, 1881, was a memorable day in Russia.
Except on the occasion of the death of Skobelef,
there were never seen in St. Petersburg such
significant and imposing obsequies. From an
early hour the whole population were standing
in the street, one hundred thousand persons
along the line where the procession was to pass.
More than twenty thousand persons followed it.
The government was alarmed, fearing some serious
disturbance. They thought the corpse might
be seized, and they had to repress the students
who wanted to have the chains of the Siberian
prisoner carried behind the funeral car. The
timorous officials insisted upon preventing all
risk of a revolutionary uprising. This was at
the time of the most important of the Nihilist conspiracies,
only one month previous to that one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
which cost the Tsar his life, during the time
of that experiment of the liberal leader, Loris
Melikof. Russia was at this moment in a state
of fermentation, and the most trifling incident
might produce an explosion. Loris thought it
wiser to associate himself with the popular sentiment
than to try to crush it out. He was right;
the wicked designs of a few men were absorbed
in the general grief. Through one of those unexpected
combinations, of which Russia alone possesses
the secret, all parties, all adversaries, all
the disjointed fragments of the empire, now came
together, through the death of this man, in a
general communion of grief and enthusiasm.
Whoever witnessed this funeral procession saw
this country of contrasts illustrated in all its
phases; the priests who chanted the service, the
students of the universities, the school children,
the young female students from the medical
schools, the Nihilists, easily recognized by their
peculiarities of dress and bearing, the men wearing
a plaid over the shoulder, the spectacles and
closely cut hair of the women; all the literary
and scientific societies, deputations from every
part of the empire, old Muscovite merchants,
peasants, lackeys, and beggars. In the church
waited the official dignitaries, the minister of
public instruction, and the young princes of the
imperial family.</p>

<p>A forest of banners, crosses, and wreaths were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
borne by that army, which was made up of such
various elements, and produced in the spectator
such a medley of impressions. To me everything
that passed seemed an illustration of the author’s
work, formed of elements both formidable and
restless, with all their folly and grandeur. In
the first rank, and most numerous, were those he
loved best, the ‘poor people,’ the ‘degraded,’
the ‘insulted,’ the ‘possessed’ even, glad to take
part in leading the remains of their advocate over
this path of glory;—but accompanying and surrounding
all were the uncertainty and confusion
of the national life, as he had painted it, filled
with all the vague hopes that he had stirred.</p>

<p>The crowd pressed into the little church, decked
with flowers, and into the cemetery around it.
Then there was a Babel of words. Before the
altar the high-priest discoursed of God and of
eternity, while others took the body to carry it
to the grave, and discoursed of glory. Official
orators, students, <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> and liberal committees,
men of letters and poets,—every one came
there to set forth his own ideal, to claim the
departed spirit for his cause, and parade his own
ambition over this tomb.</p>

<p>While the winter wind bore away all this eloquence
with the rustling leaves and the snow-dust
raised by the spades of the grave-diggers, I made
an effort to make, in my own mind, a fair estimate
of the man’s moral worth and of his life’s work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
I felt as much perplexed as when I had to pronounce
judgment upon his literary merit. He had
sympathized with the people, and awakened sympathy,
and even piety, in them. But what excessive
ideas and what moral convulsions he engendered!
He had given his heart to the cause, it is
true; but unaccompanied by reason, that inseparable
companion of the heart. I reviewed the
whole course of that strange life;—born in a hospital,
to a youth of poverty, illness, and trial,
exiled to Siberia, then sent to the barracks, ever
pursued by poverty and distress, always crushed,
and yet ennobled by a labor which was his salvation.
I now felt that this persecuted life should
not be judged by our standards, which may not
apply to his peculiar case, and that I must leave
him to Him who judges all hearts according to
their true merits. When I bent over his grave,
covered with laurel wreaths, the farewell words
which came to my lips were those of the student
to the poor abandoned girl, and which express
Dostoyevski’s entire creed: “It is not only before
thee that I prostrate myself, but before all
suffering humanity!”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr><br>
<br>
<span class="allsmcap">NIHILISM AND MYSTICISM.—TOLSTOÏ.</span>
</h3>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Turgenef’s artistic work, illustrative of the
national characteristics, we have witnessed the
birth of the Russian romance, and how it has naturally
tended toward the psychological classification
of a few general types; or, perhaps, more
justly, toward the contemplation of them, when
we consider with what serenity this artist’s moral
investigations were conducted. Dostoyevski has
shown a spirit quite contrary to this, uncultured
and yet subtile, sympathetic, tortured by tragic
visions, morbidly preoccupied by exceptional and
perverted types. The first of these two writers
was constantly coquetting, so to speak, with liberal
doctrines: the second was a <dfn>Slavophile</dfn> of the
most extreme type.</p>

<p>In Tolstoï, other surprises are reserved for us.
Younger by ten years than his predecessors, he
hardly felt the influences of 1848. Attached to
no particular school, totally indifferent to all political
parties, despising them in fact, this solitary,
meditative nobleman acknowledges no master and
no sect; he is himself a spontaneous phenomenon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
His first great novel was contemporary with
“Fathers and Sons”, but between the two great
novelists there is a deep abyss. The one still
made use of the traditions of the past, while he
acknowledged the supremacy of Western Europe,
and appropriated to himself and his work what he
learned of us; the other broke off wholly with the
past and with foreign bondage; he is a personification
of the New Russia, feeling its way out of
the darkness, impatient of any tendency toward
the adoption of our tastes and ideas, and often incomprehensible
to us. Let us not expect Russia
to do what she is incapable of, to restrict herself
within certain limits, to concentrate her attention
upon one point, or bring her conception of life
down to one doctrine. Her literary productions
must reflect the moral chaos which she is passing
through. Tolstoï comes to her aid. More truly
than any other man, and more completely than
any other, he is the translator and propagator of
that condition of the Russian mind which is called
Nihilism. To seek to know how far he has accomplished
this, would be to turn around constantly
in the same circle. This writer fills the double
function of the mirror which reflects the light
and sends it back increased tenfold in intensity,
producing fire. In the religious confessions which
he has lately written, the novelist, changed into a
theologian, gives us, in a few lines, the whole history
of his soul’s <span class="lock">experience:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
“I have lived in this world fifty-five years;
with the exception of the fourteen or fifteen years
of childhood, I have lived thirty-five years a Nihilist
in the true sense of the word,—not a socialist
or a revolutionist according to the perverted sense
acquired by usage, but a true Nihilist—that is,
subject to no faith or creed whatever.”</p>

<p>This long delayed confession was quite unnecessary;
the man’s entire work published it,
although the dreadful word is not once expressed
by him. Critics have called Turgenef the father
of Nihilism because he had given a name to the
malady, and described a few cases of it. One
might as well affirm the cholera to have been introduced
by the first physician who gave the
diagnosis of it, instead of by the first person attacked
by the scourge. Turgenef discovered the
evil, and studied it objectively; Tolstoï suffered
from it from the first day of its appearance, without
having, at first, a very clear consciousness of
his condition; his tortured soul cries out on every
page he has written, to express the agony which
weighs down so many other souls of his own race.
If the most interesting books are those which
faithfully picture the existence of a fraction of
humanity at a given moment of history, this age
has produced nothing more remarkable, in regard
to its literary quality, than his work. I do not
hesitate in giving my opinion that this writer,
when considered merely as a novelist, is one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
the greatest masters in literature our century has
produced. It may be asked how we can venture
to express ourselves so strongly of a still living
contemporary, whose overcoat and beard are
familiar objects in every-day life, who dines, reads
the papers, receives money from his publishers and
invests it, who does, in short, just what other men
do. How can we thus elevate a man before his
body has turned to ashes, and his name become
transfigured by the accumulated respect of several
generations? As for me, I cannot help seeing
this man as great as he will appear after death, or
subscribing voluntarily to Flaubert’s exclamation,
as he read Turgenef’s translation of Tolstoï, and
cried in a voice of thunder, while he stamped
heavily upon the <span class="lock">ground:—</span></p>

<p>“He is a second Shakespeare!”</p>

<p>Tolstoï’s troubled, vacillating mind, obscured
by the mists of Nihilism, is by a singular and not
infrequent contradiction endowed with an unparalleled
lucidity and penetration for the scientific
study of the phenomena of life. He has a clear,
analytical comprehension of everything upon the
earth’s surface, of man’s internal life as well as of
his exterior nature: first of tangible realities,
then the play of his passions, his most volatile
motives to action, the slightest disturbances of
his conscience. This author might be said to
possess the skill of an English chemist with the
soul of a Hindu Buddhist. Whoever will undertake
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
to account for that strange combination will
be capable of explaining Russia herself.</p>

<p>Tolstoï maintains a certain simplicity of nature
in the society of his fellow-beings which seems to
be impossible to the writers of our country; he
observes, listens, takes in whatever he sees and
hears, and for all time, with an exactness which
we cannot but admire. Not content with describing
the distinctive features of the general physiognomy
of society, he resolves them into their
original elements with the most assiduous care;
always eager to know how and wherefore an act
is produced; pursuing the original thought behind
the visible act, he does not rest until he has laid it
bare, tearing it from the heart with all its secret
roots and fibres. Unfortunately, his curiosity will
not let him stop here. Of those phenomena which
offer him such a free field when he studies them
by themselves, he wishes to know the origin, and
to go back to the most remote and inaccessible
causes which produced them. Then his clear
vision grows dim, the intrepid explorer loses his
foothold and falls into the abyss of philosophical
contradictions. Within himself, and all around
him he feels nothing but chaos and darkness; to
fill this void and illuminate the darkness, the
characters through which he speaks have recourse
to the unsatisfactory explanations of metaphysics,
and, finally, irritated by these pedantic sophistries,
they suddenly steal away, and escape from
their own explanations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Gradually, as Tolstoï advances in life and in
his work, he is more and more engulfed in doubt;
he lavishes his coldest irony upon those children
of his fancy who try to believe and to discover
and apply a consistent system of morality. But
under this apparent coldness you feel that his
heart sobs out a longing for what he cannot find,
and thirsts for things eternal. Finally, weary of
doubt and of search, convinced that all the calculations
of reason end only in mortifying failure,
fascinated by the mysticism which had long lain
in wait for his unsatisfied soul, the Nihilist suddenly
throws himself at the feet of a Deity,—and
of what a Deity we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>In finishing this chapter, I must speak of the
singular phase into which the writer’s mind has
fallen of late. I hope to do this with all the reserve
due to a living man, and all due respect for a
sincere conviction. There is nothing to me more
curious than his statement of the actual condition
of his own soul. It is a picture of the crisis
which the Russian conscience is now passing
through, seen in full sunlight, foreshortened, and
upon a lofty height. This thinker is the perfect
type of a multitude of minds, as well as their
guide; he tries to say what these minds confusedly
feel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<h4>
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>Leo Nikolaievitch (Tolstoï) was born in the
year 1828. The course of his external life has
offered nothing of interest to the lovers of
romance, being quite the same as that of Russian
gentlemen in general. In his father’s house in
the country, and afterwards at the University of
Kazan, he received the usual education from foreign
masters which gives to the cultivated classes
in Russia their cosmopolitan turn of mind. He
then entered the army and spent several years in
the Caucasus in a regiment of artillery, and was
afterwards transferred at his request to Sebastopol.
He went through the famous siege in the
Crimean War, which he has illustrated by three
striking sketches: “Sebastopol in December, in
May, and in August.” Resigning his position
when peace was declared, Count Tolstoï first
travelled extensively, then settled at St. Petersburg
and Moscow, living in the society of his own
class. He studied society and the court as he
had studied the war—with that serious attention
which tears away the masks from all faces and
reads the inmost heart. After a few winters of
fashionable life, he left the capital, partly, it is
said, to escape from the different literary circles
which were anxious to claim him among their
votaries. In 1860, he married and retired to his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
ancestral estate, near Tula, where he has remained
almost constantly for twenty-five years.
The whole history of his own life is hardly disguised
in the autobiography he wrote, entitled,
“Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth.” The evolution
of his inward experience is further carried
out in the two great novels, “War and Peace”
and “Anna Karenina,” and ends, as might have
been foreseen, with the theological and moral
essays which have for some years quite absorbed
his intellectual activity.</p>

<p>I believe the author’s first composition, while
he was an officer in the army of the Caucasus,
must have been the novelette published later
under the title, “The Cossacks.” This is the
least systematic of all his works, and is perhaps
the one which best betrays the precocious originality
of his mind, and his remarkable power of
seeing and representing truth. This book marks
a date in literature: the definite rupture of Russian
poetry with Byronism and romanticism in
the very heart of their former reign. The influence
of Byron was so strong that the prejudiced
eyes of the poets saw the Orient in which they
lived through their poetical fancy, which transfigured
both scenery and men. Attracted like so
many other writers toward this region, Tolstoï,
or, rather, Olenin, the hero of the Cossacks (I
believe them to be one and the same), leaves
Moscow one beautiful evening, after a farewell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
supper with his young friends. Weary of civilization,
he throws off his habitual thoughts as he
would a worn-out garment; his <dfn>troïka</dfn> bears him
away to a strange country; he longs for a primitive
life, new sensations, new interests.</p>

<p>Our traveller installs himself in one of the little
Cossack settlements on the river Terek; he adopts
the life of his new friends, takes part in their
expeditions and hunts; an old mountaineer, who
somewhat recalls Fenimore Cooper’s “Leatherstocking,”
undertakes to be his guide. Olenin
quite naturally falls in love with the lovely
Marianna, daughter of his host. Tolstoï will
now show us the Orient in a new light, in the
mirror of truth. For the lyric visions of his
predecessors he substitutes a philosophical view
of men and things. From the very first this
acute observer understood how puerile it is to
lend to these creatures of instinct our refinement
of thought and feeling, our theatrical way
of representing passion. The dramatic interest
of his tale consists in the fatal want of mutual
understanding that must, perforce, exist between
the heart of a civilized being and that of a wild,
savage creature, and the total impossibility of two
souls of such different calibre blending in a
mutual passion. Olenin tries in vain to cultivate
simplicity of feeling. Because he dons a
Circassian cap, he cannot at the same time
change his nature and become primitive. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
love cannot separate itself from all the intellectual
complications which our literary education
lends to this passion. He <span class="lock">says:—</span></p>

<p>“What there is terrible and at the same time
interesting in my condition is that I feel that I
understand Marianna and that she never will be
able to understand me. Not that she is inferior
to me,—quite the contrary; but it is impossible
for her to understand me. She is happy; she is
natural; she is like Nature itself, equable, tranquil,
happy in herself.”</p>

<p>The character of this little Asiatic, strange and
wild as a young doe, is beautifully drawn. I
appeal to those who are familiar with the East
and have proved the falsity of those Oriental
types invented by European literature. They
will find in the “The Cossacks,” a surprising exposure
of the falsity of that other moral world.
Tolstoï has brought this country before us by
his vivid and picturesque descriptions of its natural
features. The little idyl serves as a pretext
for magnificent descriptions of the Caucasus;
steppe, forest, and mountain stand before us as
vividly as the characters which inhabit them.
The grand voices of Nature join in with and
support the human voices, as an orchestra leads
and sustains a chorus. The author, absorbed as
he was afterwards in the study of the human soul,
never again expressed such a profound sympathy
with nature as in this work. At this time Tolstoï
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
was inclined to be both pantheist and pessimist,
vacillating between the two. “Trois Morts,” a
fragment of his, contains the substance of this
<span class="lock">philosophy:—</span></p>

<p>“The happiest man, and the best, is he who
thinks the least and who lives the simplest life
and dies the simplest death. Accordingly, the
peasant is better than the lord, the tree is better
than the peasant, and the death of an oak-tree is
a greater calamity to the world than the death of
an old princess.”</p>

<p>This is Rousseau’s doctrine exaggerated: the
man who thinks is not only a depraved animal
but an inferior plant. But Pantheism is another
attempt at a rational explanation of the universe:
Nihilism will soon replace it. This monster has
already devoured the inmost soul of the man,
without his even being conscious of it. It is easy
to be convinced of this when we read his “Childhood,
Boyhood, and Youth.” It is the journal of
the gradual awakening of an intelligence to life;
it lays before us the whole secret of the formation
of Tolstoï’s moral character. The author subjects
his own conscience to that penetrating, inexorable
analysis, which later he will use upon society; he
tries his hand upon himself first of all. It is a
singular book, lengthy, and sometimes trivial;
Dickens is rapid and sketchy in comparison with
him. In relating the course of a most ordinary
journey from the country into Moscow, he counts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
every turn of the wheels, notes every passing
peasant, every guide-post. But this fastidious
observance of details, applied to trivial facts, becomes
a wonderful instrument when applied to
human nature and to psychological researches. It
throws light upon the man’s own inner conscience,
without regard to his self-love; he sees himself as
he is, and lays bare his soul with all its petty
vanities, and the ingratitude and mistrust of an
ill-humored child. We shall recognize this same
child in the principal characters of his great
novels, with its nature quite unchanged. I will
quote two passages which show us the very foundation
of Nihilism in the brain of a lad of <span class="lock">sixteen:—</span></p>

<p>“Of all philosophical doctrines, the one which
attracted me most strongly was skepticism; for a
time it brought me to a condition verging upon
madness. I would imagine that nothing whatever
existed in the world except myself; that all
objects were only illusions, evoked by myself just
at the moment I gave attention to them, and
which vanished the moment I ceased to think of
them…. There were times when, possessed by
this idea, I was brought into such a bewildered
state that I would turn quickly around and look
behind me, hoping to be able to pierce through
the chaos which lay beyond me. My enfeebled
mind could not penetrate through the impenetrable,
and would lose by degrees in this wearisome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
struggle the certainties which for the sake
of my own happiness, I ought never to have
sought. I reaped nothing from all this intellectual
effort but an activity of mind which weakened
my will-power, and a habit of incessant
moral analysis which robbed every sensation of
its freshness and warped my judgment on every
subject….”</p>

<p>Such a cry might have been uttered by a disciple
of Schelling. But listen to what follows from the
heart of a Russian, who speaks for his countrymen
as well as <span class="lock">himself:—</span></p>

<p>“When I remember how young I was, and the
state of mind I was in, I realize perfectly how the
most atrocious crimes might be committed without
reason or a desire to injure any one, but, so to
speak, from a sort of curiosity or an unconscious
necessity of action. There are times when the
future appears to a man so dark that he fears to
look into it; and he totally suspends the exercise
of his own reason within himself, and tries to persuade
himself that there is no future and that
there has been no past. At such moments, when
the mind no longer controls the will, when the
material instincts are the only springs of life
left to us,—I can understand how an inexperienced
child can, without hesitation or fear, and
with a smile of curiosity, set fire to his own house,
in which all those he loves best—father, mother,
and brothers—are sleeping. Under the influence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
of this temporary eclipse of the mind, which I
might call a moment of aberration or distraction,—a
young peasant lad of sixteen stands looking
at the shining blade of an axe just sharpened,
which lies under the bench upon which his old
father has fallen asleep: suddenly he brandishes
the axe, and finds himself looking with stupid
curiosity, upon the stream of blood under the
bench which is flowing from the aged head he has
just cleft. In this condition of mind, a man likes
to lean over a precipice and think: ‘What if I
should throw myself over head first!’ or to put a
loaded pistol to his forehead and think: ‘Suppose
I should pull the trigger!’ or when he sees a
person of dignity and consequence surrounded by
the universal respect of all, and suddenly feels
impelled to go up to him and take him by the
nose, saying: ‘Come along, old fellow!’”</p>

<p>This is pure childishness, you will say! So
it would be in our steadier brains and more
active lives, rarely disturbed by these attacks of
nightmare. Turgenef has touched upon this
national malady of his fellow-countrymen in his
last tale, “Despair,” as well as Dostoyevski in
many of his. There are several cases in “Recollections
of a Dead House,” identical with those
described by Tolstoï, although the two authors’
treatment of this theme are so unlike. The word
in their language which expresses this condition is
quite untranslatable. <em>Despair</em> approaches it nearest;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
but the condition is a mixture also of fatalism,
barbarism, asceticism, and other qualities, or want
of them. It may describe, perhaps, Hamlet’s
mental malady or attack of madness, at the
moment he ran his sword through Polonius, father
of his Ophelia. It seems to be a sort of horrible
fascination which belongs to cold countries, to a
climate of extremes, where they learn to endure
everything better than an ordinary fate, and prefer
annihilation to moderation.</p>

<p>Poor Russia! a tempest-tossed sea-gull, hovering
over an abyss!</p>

<p>Nihilist and pessimist,—are not these synonymous
words, and must they not both exist in the
same person? From this time, all Tolstoï’s productions
would argue this to be the fact. A few
short tales are a prelude to his two great novels,
which we must now make a study of, as to them
he devoted his highest powers and concentrated
upon them his profoundest thought. His talent
heretofore had produced but fragmentary compositions
and sketches.</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>“War and Peace” is a picture of Russian
society during the great Napoleonic wars, from
1805 to 1815. We question whether this complicated
work can be properly called a novel. “War
and Peace” is a summary of the author’s observations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
of human life in general. The interminable
series of episodes, portraits, and reflections which
Tolstoï presents to us are introduced through a
few fictitious characters; but the real hero of this
epic is Russia herself, passing through her desperate
struggle against the foreign invader. The real
characters, Alexander, Napoleon, Kutuzof, Speranski,
occupy nearly as much space as the imaginary
ones; the simple and rather slack thread of
romance serves to bind together the various chapters
on history, politics, philosophy, heaped pell-mell
into this polygraph of the Russian world.
Imagine Victor Hugo’s “Les Misérables” being
re-written by Dickens in his untiring, exhaustless
manner, then re-constructed by the cold,
searching pen of Stendhal, and you may possibly
form an idea of the general arrangement and
execution of the work, and of that curious union
of epic grandeur and infinitesimal analytical
detail. I try to fancy M. Meissonier painting a
panorama; I doubt if he could do it, but if he
could his twofold talent would illustrate the
double character of Tolstoï’s work.</p>

<p>The pleasure to be derived from it resembles
that from mountain-climbing; the way is often
rough and wild, the path, as you ascend, difficult
to find, effort and fatigue are indispensable; but
when you reach the summit and look around you
the reward is great. Magnificent vistas stretch
beneath you; he who has never accomplished the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
ascent will never know the true face of the country,
the course of its rivers or the relative situation
of its towns. A stranger, therefore, who
would understand Russia of the nineteenth century,
must read Tolstoï; and whoever would undertake
to write a history of that country would utterly
fail in his task if he neglected to consult this
exhaustless repository of the national life. Those
who have a passion for the study of history will
not, perhaps, grow impatient over this mass of
characters and succession of trivial incidents with
which the work is loaded down. Will it be the
same with those who seek only amusement in a
work of fiction? For these, Tolstoï will break up
all previous habits. This incorrigible analyst is
either ignorant of or disdains the very first method
of procedure employed by all our writers; we
expect our novelist to select out his character or
event, and separate it from the surrounding chaos
of beings and objects, making a special study of
the object of his choice. The Russian, ruled by
the sentiment of universal dependence, is never
willing to cut the thousand ties which bind men,
actions, thoughts, to the rest of the universe; he
never forgets the natural mutual dependence of
all things. Imagine the Latin and the Slav before
a telescope. The first arranges it to suit himself;
that is, he voluntarily foreshortens his range of
vision, to make more distinct what he sees, and
diminish the extent of it; the second requires the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
full power of the instrument, enlarges his horizon,
and sees a confused picture, for the sake of seeing
farther.</p>

<p>In a passage in “Anna Karenina,” Tolstoï well
defines the contrast between two such natures,
and the mutual attraction they exert upon each
other. Levin, the dreamer, meets one of his
friends, who is of a methodical turn of mind.</p>

<p>“Levin imagined that Katavasof’s clearness of
conception came from the poverty and narrowness
of his nature; Katavasof thought that Levin’s
incoherency of ideas arose from the want of a
well disciplined mind; but the clearness of Katavasof
pleased Levin, and the natural richness of
an undisciplined mind in the latter was agreeable
to the other.”</p>

<p>These lines sum up all the grounds of complaint
that the Russians have to reproach us with
in our literature, and those we have against
theirs; which differences explain the pleasure
the two races find in an interchange of their
literary productions.</p>

<p>It is easy to predict what impressions all readers
of “War and Peace” and “Anna Karenina”
will receive. I have seen the same effect invariably
produced upon all who have read those
books. At first, for some time, the reader will
hardly find his bearings; not knowing whither he
is being led, he will soon grow weary of the task
that lies before him. But little by little he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
be drawn on, captivated by the complex action of
all these characters, among whom he will find himself,
as well as some of his friends, and will become
most anxious to unravel the secret of their destinies.
On closing the book, he feels a sense of
regret, as if parting with a family with which he
has been for years on terms of familiar intercourse.
He has passed through the experience
of the traveller thrown into the novelty of new
society and surroundings; he feels annoyance
and fatigue at first, then curiosity, and finally
has formed deeply rooted attachments.</p>

<p>What seems to me the distinction between the
classic author and a conscientious painter of life as
it is, like Tolstoï, is this: a book is like a drawing-room
filled with strangers; the first type of
author voluntarily presents you to this company
at once, and unveils to you the thousand intertwining
combinations, incidents, and intrigues
going on there; with the second you must go
forward and present yourself, find out for yourself
the persons of mark, the various relations and
sentiments of the entire circle, live, in fact, in the
midst of this fictitious company, just as you have
lived in society, among real people. To be able
to judge of the respective merit of the two
methods, we must interrogate one of the fundamental
laws of our being. Is there any pleasure
worth having which does not cost some little
trouble? Do we not prefer what we have acquired
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
by an effort all our own? Let us reflect
upon this. Whatever may be our individual
preferences in regard to intellectual pleasure, I
think we can agree on one point: in the old,
well worn paths of literature, mediocrity may be
tolerated; but when an author strikes out in a
new path we cannot tolerate a partial success; he
must write dramas equal to Shakespeare, and
romances as good as Tolstoï’s, to give us a true
picture of life as it is. This we have in “War
and Peace,” and the question of its success has
been decided in the author’s favor. When I visit
with him the soldiers in camp, the court, and
court society, which has hardly changed in the
last half-century, and see how he lays bare the
hearts of men, I cry out at every page I read:
“How true that is!” As we go on, our curiosity
changes into astonishment, astonishment into
admiration, before this inexorable judge, who
brings every human action before his tribunal,
and forces from every heart its secrets. We feel
as if drawn on with the current of a tranquil,
never-ending stream, the stream of human life,
carrying with it the hearts of men, with all their
agitated and complicated movements and emotions.</p>

<p>War is one of the social phenomena which has
strongly attracted our author and philosopher.
He is present at the Council of Generals and at
the soldiers’ bivouac; he studies the moral condition
of each; he understands the orders, and why
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
they should be obeyed. He presents to us the
whole physiognomy of the Russian army. A
minute description which he gives of a disorderly
retreat is second only to Schiller’s “Camp of
Wallenstein.” He describes the first engagement,
the first cannon-shot, the fall of the first
soldier, the agony of that long-dreaded moment.</p>

<p>In the course of these volumes the imperial
battles are portrayed; Austerlitz, Friedland, Borodino.
Tolstoï talks of war like a man who has
taken part in it; he knows that a battle is never
witnessed by the participants. The soldier, officer,
or general which the writer introduces never
sees but a single point of the combat; but by the
way in which a few men fight, think, talk, and
die on that spot, we understand the entire action,
and know on what side the victory will be.</p>

<p>When Tolstoï wishes to give us a general description
of anything, he ingeniously makes use of
some artifice; as, for example, in the engagement
at Schöngraben he introduces an aide-de-camp who
carries an order the whole length of the line of battle.
Then the corps commanders bring in their
reports, not of what has taken place, but of what
naturally ought to have taken place. How is
this? “The colonel had so strongly desired to
execute this movement, he so regretted not having
been able to carry it out, that it seemed to
him that all must have taken place as he wished.
Perhaps it really had! Is it ever possible in such
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
confusion to find out what has or has not occurred?”—How
perfect is this ironical explanation!
I appeal to any soldier who has ever taken
part in any action in war, and heard an account
given of it by the other participants.</p>

<p>We do not demand of this realistic writer the
conventional ideas of the classic authors;—an entire
army heroic as its leaders, living only for the
great causes it accomplishes, wholly absorbed in
its lofty aim. Tolstoï reveals human nature: the
soldier’s life, careless, occupied with trifling
duties; the officers, with their pleasures or
schemes of promotion; the generals, with their
ambitions and intrigues; all these seeming quite
accustomed and indifferent to what to us appears
extraordinary and imposing. However, the
author, by dint of sheer simplicity, sometimes
draws tears of sympathy from us for those unconscious
heroes, such as, for example, the pathetic
character of Captain Touchino, which recalls
Renault, in “Servitude et Grandeur Militaires.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a>
Tolstoï is severe upon the leaders of the Russian
army; he reminds us of the councils of war after
the late trials; he satirizes the French and German
strategists by whom Alexander was surrounded;
and, with his Nihilistic ideas, he
thoroughly enjoys describing this Babel of
tongues and opinions. With one man alone he
secretly sympathizes—with the commander-in-chief,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
Kutuzof. And why?—Because he gave
no orders, and went to sleep during the council,
giving up everything to fate. All these descriptions
of military life converge toward this idea,
which is developed in the philosophical appendix
to the novel; all action on the part of the commanders
is vain and useless; everything depends
upon the fortuitous action of small divisions, the
only decisive factor being one of those unforeseen
impulses or inspirations which at certain times
impels an army. As regards battle array, who
thinks of it on the spot when thousands of possible
combinations arise? The military genius in
command sees only the smoke; he invariably
receives his information and issues his orders too
late. Can the commander carry out any general
plan who is leading on his troops, which number
ten, fifty, or one hundred men out of one hundred
thousand, within a small radius? The rest of the
account you may find in the next day’s bulletins!
Over the three hundred thousand combatants
fighting in the plains of Borodino blows the wind
of chance, bringing victory or defeat.</p>

<p>Here is the same mystic spirit of Nihilism
which springs up before every problem of life.</p>

<p>After war, the study which Tolstoï loves best,
come the intrigues of the higher classes of society
and its centre of gravitation, the court. As differences
of race grow less distinct as we approach
the higher classes of society, the novelist creates
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
no longer merely Russian types, but general,
human, universal ones. Since St. Simon, no one
has so curiously unveiled the secret mechanism
of court life. We are very apt to distrust writers
of fiction when they attempt to depict these
hidden spheres; we suspect them of listening
behind doors and peeping through key-holes. But
this Russian author is in his native element; he
has frequented and studied the court as he has the
army; he talks of his peers in their own language,
and has had the same education and culture;
therefore his information is copious and
correct, like what you obtain from the comedian
who divulges the secrets of the boards.</p>

<p>Go with the author into the salons of certain
ladies of the court; listen to the tirades of refugees,
the opinions expressed upon Buonaparte, the
intrigues of the courtiers, and that peculiar
accent when they mention any member of the
imperial family. Visit with him a statesman’s
home; sit down at Speranski’s table (the man
who “laughs a stage laugh”); mark the sovereign’s
passage through a ball-room by the light
which is visible upon every face from the moment
he enters the apartment; above all, visit the
death-bed of old Count Bezushof, and witness the
tragedy which is being acted under the mask of
etiquette; the struggle of base instincts around
that speechless, expiring old man, and the general
agitation. Here a sinister element, as elsewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
a lofty one, lends marvellous force to the
simple sincerity of the picture and to the restraint
which propriety imposes upon faces and tongues.</p>

<p>Every passage in which the Emperors Napoleon
and Alexander appear in action or speech should
be read in order to understand the place that
Nihilism occupies in the Russian mind so far as
regards the denial of the grandeur and respect
accorded by general consent to such potentates.
The writer speaks in a deferential tone, as if he
would in no wise curtail the majesty of power;
but by bringing it down to the most trivial exigencies
of life he utterly destroys it. Scattered
through the tale we find ten or twelve little
sketches of Napoleon drawn with great care,
without hostility or an approach to caricature; but
merely by withdrawing him from the legendary
halo surrounding him, the man’s greatness crumbles
away. It is generally some physical peculiarity
or trivial act, skilfully introduced, which
seems quite incompatible with the sceptre and
the imperial robes. With Napoleon, Tolstoï evidently
takes great liberties; but it is curious to
note these descriptive touches when applied to his
own sovereign. With infinite precautions and
perfect propriety, the spell of majesty is broken
through the incongruity of the man’s actual habits
and the formidable rôle he plays. I will quote
one of the many examples of this kind (Alexander
is at Moscow, in 1812; he receives the ovations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
of his people at the Kremlin, at the solemn
hour when war is proclaimed): “When the Tzar
had dined, the master of ceremonies said, looking
out of the window, ‘The people are hoping to see
your Majesty.’ The emperor, who was eating a
biscuit, rose and went out on the balcony. The
people rushed towards the terrace. ‘Our emperor!
Our father! Hurrah! Hurrah!’ cried the
people. Many women and a few men actually
wept for joy. Quite a large piece of the biscuit
the emperor held in his hand broke off and fell
upon the balustrade, and from that to the ground.
The man nearest to it was a cab-driver, in a blouse,
who made a rush for the piece and seized it.
Others rushed upon the coachman; whereupon
the emperor had a plateful of biscuit brought, and
began to throw them from the balcony to the
crowd. Pierre’s eyes became blood-shot; the
danger of being crushed only excited him the
more, and he pressed forward through the crowd.
He could not have told why he felt that he positively
must have one of those biscuit thrown by
the hand of the Tzar….”</p>

<p>Again, there is nothing more true to nature
than the account of the audience granted by the
Emperor of Austria to Bolkonski, who had been
despatched as a courier to Brünn with the news
of a victory of the allies. The writer describes
so well the gradual disenchantment of the young
officer, who sees his great battle vanish before his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
eyes in the opinion of men. He quitted the
scene of the exploit expecting to astonish the
world with the announcement he now brings;
but on his arrival at Brünn a bucket of cold
water has been thrown over his dreams by the
“polite” aide-de-camp, the minister of war, the
emperor himself, who addresses a few words to
him in an absent way—the ordinary questions as
to the time of day, the particular spot where the
affair took place, and the usual indispensable
compliments. When he takes his leave, after
reflecting upon the subject from the point of view
of other men, according to their respective interests,
poor Bolkonski finds his battle much diminished
in grandeur, and also a thing of the past.</p>

<p>“Andé felt that his whole interest and joy over
the victory was sinking away from him into the
indifferent hands of the minister of war and the
‘polite’ aide-de-camp. His whole train of thought
had become modified; there seemed to be nothing
left to him but a dim, distant recollection of
the battle.”</p>

<p>This is one of the phenomena most closely analyzed
by Tolstoï—this variable influence exerted
upon man by his surroundings. He likes to
plunge his characters successively into different
atmospheres,—that of the soldier’s life, the country,
the fashionable world,—and then to show us
the corresponding moral changes in them. When
a man, after having for some time been under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
empire of thoughts and passions previously foreign
to him, returns into his former sphere, his
views on all subjects change at once. Let us
follow young Nikolai Rostof when he returns
from the army to his home, and back again to his
cavalry regiment. He is not the same person,
but seems to be possessed of two souls. On the
journey back and forth to Moscow, he gradually
lays aside or resumes the one which his profession
requires.</p>

<p>It is useless to multiply examples of Tolstoï’s
psychological curiosity, which is ever awake. It
forms the principal feature of his genius. He
loves to analyze the human puppet in every part.
A stranger enters the room; the author studies
his expression, voice, and step; he shows us the
depths of the man’s soul. He explains a glance
interchanged between two persons, in which he
discovers friendship, fear, a feeling of superiority
in one of them; in fact, a perfect knowledge of
the mutual relations of these two men. This
relentless physician constantly feels the pulse of
every one who crosses his path, and coolly notes
down the condition of his health, morally speaking.
He proceeds in an objective manner, never
directly describing a person except by making
him act out his characteristics.</p>

<p>This fundamental precept of classic art has
been adopted by this realistic writer in his desire
to imitate real life, in which we learn to comprehend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
people by trivial indications and by points
of resemblance, without any information as to
their position or qualities. A good deal of art is
required to discern clearly in this apparent chaos,
and you have a large choice in the formidable
accumulation of details. Observe how, in the
course of a conversation or the narration of some
episode, Tolstoï makes the actors visibly present
before us by calling our attention to one of their
gestures, or some little absurd, peculiar habit, or
by interrupting their conversation to show us
the direction of their glances. This occurs constantly.</p>

<p>There is also a good deal of wit in this serious
style; not the flashes and sallies of wit that we
are familiar with, but of a fine, penetrating quality,
with subtle and singularly apt comparisons.</p>


<p class="center">
<abbr title="Three">III.</abbr><br>
</p>

<p>Among the numerous characters in “War and
Peace,” the action is concentrated upon two only—Prince
André Bolkonski and Pierre Bezushof.
These remarkable types of character are well worthy
of attention. In them the double aspect of
the Russian soul, as well as of the author’s own,
is reflected with all its harassing thoughts and
contradictions. Prince André is a nobleman of
high rank, looking down from his lofty position
upon the life he despises; proud, cold, sceptical,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
atheistic, although at times his mind is tortured
with anxiety concerning great problems.
Through him the author pronounces his verdicts
upon the historical characters of the time, and
discourses of the various statesmen and their
intrigues.</p>

<p>André is received at Speranski’s. We know
the wonderful influence acquired by this man,
who almost established a new constitution in
Russia. Speranski’s most striking trait, in Prince
André’s opinion, was his absolute, unshaken faith
in the force and legitimacy of reason. This trait
was what particularly attracted André to him,
and explains the ascendency that Speranski acquired
over his sovereign and his country.
André, having been seriously wounded at Austerlitz,
lies on the battle-field, his eyes raised to
heaven. The dying man <span class="lock">exclaims:—</span></p>

<p>“Oh, could I now but say, ‘Lord, have pity
upon me!’ But who will hear me? Shall I
address an indefinite, unapproachable Power,
which cannot itself be expressed in words, the
great All or Nothing, or that image of God which
is within the amulet that Marie gave me?…
There is nothing certain except the nothingness
of everything that I have any conception of, and
the majesty of something beyond my conception!”</p>

<p>Pierre Bezushof is more human in character,
but his intelligence is of quite as mysterious a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
quality. He is a stout man, of lymphatic temperament,
absent-minded; a man who blushes
and weeps easily, susceptible to love, sympathetic
with all suffering. He is a type of the kind-hearted
Russian noblemen, nervous, deficient
in will, a constant prey to the ideas and influence
of others; but under his gross exterior lives a
soul so subtle, so mystic, that it might well be
that of a Hindu monk. One day, after Pierre
had given his word of honor to his friend André
that he would not go to a midnight revel of some
of his young friends, he hesitated when the hour
of meeting came.</p>

<p>“‘After all,’ he thought, ‘all pledges of words
are purely conventional, without definite meaning,
when you reflect about it. I may die to-morrow,
or some extraordinary event take place, in
consequence of which the question of honor or
dishonor will not even arise.’</p>

<p>“Reflections of this sort—destructive of all
resolve or method—often occupied Pierre’s
mind….” Tolstoï has skilfully made use of
this weak nature, which is as receptive of all
impressions as a photographer’s plate, to give us
a clear conception of the chief currents of ideas
in Russia in the reign of Alexander <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>; these successively
influence this docile adept with all their
changes. We see the liberal movement of the
earlier years of that reign developed in the mind
of Bezushof, as afterwards the mystic and theosophic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">maze of its later years. Pierre personifies</span><br>
the sentiments of the people in 1812, the
national revolt against foreign intervention, the
gloomy madness of conquered Moscow, the burning
of which has never been explained, nor is it
known by whose hands it was kindled. This
destruction of Moscow is the culminating point of
the book. The scenes of tragic grandeur, simple
in outline, sombre in color, are superior, I must
acknowledge, to anything of the kind in literature.
He pictures the entrance of the French
into the Kremlin, the prisoners and lunatics
roaming by night in freedom about the burning
city, the roads filled with long columns of fugitives
escaping from the flames, beside many other
very striking episodes.</p>

<p>Count Pierre remains in the burning city. He
leaves his palace in plebeian guise, in a peasant’s
costume, and wanders off like a person in a
trance; he walks on straight before him, with a
vague determination to kill Napoleon and be an
expiatory victim and martyr for the people. “He
was actuated by two equally strong impulses.
The first was the desire to take his part of the
self-sacrifice and universal suffering—a feeling
which, at Borodino, had impelled him to throw
himself into the thick of the battle, and which
now drove him out of the house, away from the
luxury and habitual refinements of his daily life,
to sleep on the ground and eat the coarsest of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
food. The second came from that indefinable,
exclusively Russian sentiment of contempt for
everything conventional and artificial, for all
that the majority of mankind esteem most desirable
in the world. Pierre experienced this
strange and intoxicating feeling on the day of
his flight, when it had suddenly been impressed
upon him that wealth, power, life itself, all that
men seek to gain and preserve with such great
effort, were absolutely worthless, or, at least, only
worth the luxury of the voluntary sacrifice of
these so-called blessings.” And through page
after page the author unfolds that condition of
mind that we discovered in his first writings,
that hymn of the <dfn>Nirvâna</dfn>, just as it must be sung
in Ceylon or Thibet.</p>

<p>Pierre Bezushof is certainly the elder brother
of those rich men and scholars who will some day
“go among the people,” and willingly share their
trials, carrying a dynamite bomb under their
cloaks, as Pierre carries a poniard under his,
moved by a double impulse: to share the common
suffering, and enjoy the anticipated annihilation
of themselves and others. Taken prisoner by
the French, Bezushof meets, among his companions
in misfortune, a poor soldier, a peasant, with an
uncultivated mind, one, indeed, rather beneath
the average. This man endures the hardships
on the march, through these terrible days, with
the humble resignation of a beast of burden. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
addresses Count Pierre with a cheerful smile, a
few ingenuous words, popular proverbs with but
a vague meaning, but expressing resignation, fraternity,
and, above all, fatalism. One evening,
when he can keep up with the others no longer,
the soldiers shoot him under a pine-tree, on the
snow, and the man receives death with the same
indifferent tranquillity that he does everything
else, like a wounded dog—in fact, like the brute.
At this time a moral revolution takes place in
Pierre’s soul. Here I do not expect to be intelligible
to my fellow-countrymen; I only record the
truth. The noble, cultured, learned Bezushof
takes this primitive creature for his model; he
has found at last his ideal of life in this man, who
is “poor in spirit,” as well as a rational explanation
of the moral world. The memory and name of
Karatayef are a talisman to him; thenceforward
he has but to think of the humble <dfn>muzhik</dfn>, to feel
at peace, happy, ready to comprehend and to love
the entire universe. The intellectual development
of our philosopher is accomplished; he has
reached the supreme avatar, mystic indifference.</p>

<p>When Tolstoï related this episode, he was
twenty-five years of age. Had he then a presentiment
that he should ever find his Karatayef,
that he would pass through the same crisis, experience
the same discipline, and come out of it
regenerated? We shall see later on how he had
actually prophesied his own experience, and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
from this time he, together with Dostoyevski, was
destined to establish the ideal of nearly all contemporaneous
literature in Russia. Karatayef’s
name is legion; under different names and forms,
this vegetative form of existence will be presented
for our admiration. The perfection of human
wisdom is the sanctification, deification of the
brute element, which is kind and fraternal in a
certain vague way. The root of the idea is
<span class="lock">this:—</span></p>

<p>The cultured man finds his reasoning faculties
a hindrance to him, because useless, since they
do not aid him to explain the object of his life;
therefore it is his duty to make an effort to
reject them, and descend from complications to
simplicity, in life and thought. This is the aim
and aspiration, under various forms, of Tolstoï’s
whole work.</p>

<p>He has written a series of articles on popular
education. The leading idea is <span class="lock">this:—</span></p>

<p>“I would teach the children of the common
people to think and to write; but I ought rather
to learn of them to write and to think. We seek
our ideal beyond us, when it is in reality behind
us. The development of man is not the means of
realizing that idea of harmony which we bear
within us, but, on the contrary, it is an obstacle in
the way of its realization. A healthy child born
into the world fully satisfies that ideal of truth,
beauty, and goodness, which, day by day, he will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
constantly continue to lose; he is, at birth, nearer
to the unthinking beings, to the animal, plant,
nature itself, which is the eternal type of truth,
beauty, and goodness.”</p>

<p>You can catch the thread of the idea, which is
much like the contemplative mistiness of the
ancient oriental asceticism. The Occident has not
always been free from this evil; in its ascetic
errors and deviations, it has ennobled the brute,
and falsified the divine allegory of the “poor in
spirit.” But the true source of this contagious
spirit of renunciation is in Asia, in the doctrines
of India, which spring up again, scarcely modified,
in that frenzy which is precipitating a part of Russia
toward an intellectual and moral abnegation,
sometimes developing into a stupid quietism, and
again to sublime self-devotion, like the doctrine of
Buddha. All extremes meet.</p>

<p>I will dwell no longer upon these scarcely intelligible
abstractions, but would say a word concerning
the female characters created by Tolstoï.
They are very similar to Turgenef’s heroines,
treated, perhaps, with more depth but less of tender
grace. Two characters call for special attention.
First, that of Marie Bolkonski, sister of
André, the faithful daughter, devoted to the work
of cheering the latter years of a morose old father;
a pathetic figure, as pure in outline, under the firm
touch of this artist, are the works of the old
painters. Of quite another type is Natasha Rostof,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
the passionate, fascinating young girl, beloved
by all, enslaving many hearts, bearing with her
an exhalation of love through the whole thread of
this severe work. She is sweet-tempered, straightforward,
sincere, but the victim of her own extreme
sensibility.</p>

<p>Racine might have created a Marie Bolkonski;
the Abbé Prévost would have preferred Natasha
Rostof. Betrothed to Prince André, the only man
she truly loves, Natasha yields to a fatal fancy for
a miserable fellow. Disenchanted finally, she
learns that André is wounded and dying, and
goes to nurse him in a mute agony of despair. This
part of the book presents the inexorableness of real
life in its sudden calamities. After André’s death,
Natasha marries Pierre, who has secretly loved
her. French readers will be horror-stricken at
these convulsions in the realms of passion; but it
is like life, and Tolstoï sacrifices conventionality
to the desire to paint it as it is. Do not imagine
he sought a romantic conclusion. The young
girl’s fickleness ends in conjugal felicity and the
solid joys of home life. To these the writer devotes
many pages, too many, perhaps, for our taste.
He loves to dwell upon domestic life and joys;
all other affections are in his eyes unwholesome
exceptions—exciting his curiosity but not his
sympathy. Thus he analyzes with a skilful pen,
but with visible disgust, the flirtations and
coquetry carried on in the <i lang="fr">salons</i> of St. Petersburg.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Like Turgenef, Tolstoï does not hold the ladies of
court circles in high estimation.</p>

<p>He has added a long philosophical appendix to
his romance, in which he brings up again, in a
doctrinal form, the metaphysical questions which
have tormented him the most, and once more
repeats that he is a fatalist. This appendix has
not been translated in the French edition, and this
is well, for no reader would voluntarily undergo
the useless fatigue of wading through it. Tolstoï
is unwise in pressing ideas by abstract reasoning
which he is so skilful in illustrating through his
characters; he does not realize how much more
clearly his ideas are expressed in their language
and action than in any of his own arguments.</p>

<p>“Anna Karenina,” which appeared periodically
in a Moscow review, was the result of many years’
study. The work was not published in full until
1877, and its appearance was a literary event in
Russia. I happened to be a witness of the curiosity
and interest it excited there.</p>

<p>The author intended this book to be a picture of
the society of the present day, as “War and Peace”
illustrated that of its time. The task offered the
author more difficulties, for many reasons. In the
first place, the present does not belong to us, as
does the past; it deceives us, not having become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
firmly established, so that we cannot get in all the
necessary lines and figures to emphasize it, as we
could a half-century later. Besides, the liberties
that Tolstoï could take with deceased potentates
and statesmen, as well as with ideas of the past, he
could not allow himself with contemporary ideas
and with living men. This second book on Russian
life is not as much in the style of an epic,
neither is it as strong or as complex, as the first;
on the other hand, it is more agreeable to us, as
having more unity of subject and more continuity
of action; the principal character, too, is more
perfectly developed. Although there are two
suicides and a case of adultery, Tolstoï has in
this work undertaken to write the most strictly
moral book in existence, and he has succeeded.
The main idea is duty accomplished uninfluenced
by the passions. The author portrays an existence
wholly outside of conventional lines of conduct;
and, as a contrast, the history of a pure, legitimate
affection, a happy home, and wholesome labor.
He is too much of a realist, however, to picture
an earthly paradise under any human conditions.</p>

<p>Karenina, a statesman in the highest circles of
St. Petersburg society, is a husband so greatly
absorbed in the study of political economy as to
be easily blinded and deceived in other matters.
Vronski, the seducer of his wife’s affections, is a
sincere character, devoted and self-sacrificing.
Anna is a very charming woman, tender and faithful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
where her affections are enlisted. Tolstoï has
recourse neither to hysteria nor any nervous ailment
whatever, to excuse her fall. He is sagacious
enough to know that every one’s feelings are
regulated by his or her peculiar organism; that
conscience exerts contrary influences, and that it
really exists, because it speaks and commands.
Take, for example, the description of Anna’s first
anxieties, during the night-journey between Moscow
and St. Petersburg, when she first comprehends
the state of her heart. These pages you
can never forget. She discovers Vronski in the
train, knows that he is following her, then listens
to his avowal of love. The intoxicating poison
steals into every vein, her will is no longer her
own, the dream has begun.</p>

<p>The writer takes advantage of every outward
circumstance to illustrate and color this dream in
his inimitable manner, according to his usual
method. He describes the poor woman making
an effort to fix her thoughts upon an English
novel, the snow and hail rattling against the window-panes;
then the sketches of fellow-travellers,
the various sounds and rushing of the train
through the night,—all assume a new and fantastic
meaning, as accompaniments of the agony of love
and terror which are struggling within that
woman’s soul. When, the next morning, Anna
leaves the train and steps upon the platform where
her husband is awaiting her, she says to herself:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
“Good heavens! how much longer his ears have
grown!” This exclamation reveals to us the
change that has taken place within her. How
well the author knows how to explain a whole situation
with a single phrase!</p>

<p>From the first flutter of fear to the last contortions
of despair, which lead the unhappy woman
to suicide, the novelist exposes her inmost heart,
and notes each palpitation. There is no necessity
for any tragic complication to bring about the
catastrophe. Anna has given up everything to
follow her lover; she has placed herself in such a
fatal predicament that life becomes impossible,
which is sufficient to explain her resolve.</p>

<p>In contrast with this wrecked life, the innocent
affection of Kitty and Levin continues its smooth
course. First, it is a sweet idyl, drawn with infinite
grace; then the home, the birth of children,
bringing additional joys and cares. This is the
highly moral and dull theme of the English novel,
one may say. It is similar, and yet not the same.
The British tale-writer is almost always something
of a preacher; you feel that he judges human
actions according to some preconceived rule, from
the point of view of the Established Church or of
puritanic ideas. But Tolstoï is entirely free from
all prejudices. I might almost say he has little
anxiety as to questions of morality; he constructs
his edifices according to his own idea of the best
method; the moral lesson springs only from facts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
and results, both bitter and wholesome. This is
no book for the youth of twenty, nor for a lady’s
boudoir,—a book containing no charming illusions;
but a man in full maturity relates what experience
has taught him, for the benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>These volumes present an exception in regard
to what is thought to guarantee the permanent
success of a literary work. They will be read, and
then reflected upon; we shall apply the observations
to our own souls and to others’ (the most unimportant
as well as the most general ones); then
we shall go back to his model, which will invariably
verify them. Years may pass after the first
reading, notes accumulate on the margins of the
leaves, as in many masterpieces of the classics
you find at the bottom of the pages the explanatory
remarks of generations of commentators.
In this case, they need merely to say: “<cite>Confer
vitam</cite>.”</p>

<p>Tolstoï’s style is in this work the same as in
“War and Peace.” He is like a scientific engineer
who visits some great establishment where
machines are manufactured. He studies the
mechanism of every engine, examines the most
trifling parts, measures the degree of steam-pressure,
tries the balance-valves, studies the action of
the pistons and gearing; he seeks eagerly to discover
the central motive power, the invisible
reservoir of force. While he is experimenting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
with the machinery, we, outside spectators, see
only the results of all this labor, the manufactures
of delicate fabrics with infinite variety of designs—life
itself.</p>

<p>Tolstoï shows the same qualities and defects as
in “War and Peace,” and gives the same tediously
long descriptions. The parts devoted to the pictures
of country life and rural occupations will
seem, in France, a little dull. Unfortunately, in
one sort of realistic description, we must know the
locality to appreciate the artist’s effort and the
resemblance of the picture. The description, for
instance, of the races at Tsarskoe-Selo, so appreciated
by Russian readers, could not have any
more interest for us than the brilliant account of
<i lang="fr">le grand prix de Paris</i> in “Nana” would have for
the Muscovites; on the other hand, the portraits
of Oblonski and Karenina will always retain their
power, because they express human sentiments
common to all countries and all times. I will
carry the analysis of these novels no farther, for
they will hardly admit of it; we could scarcely
choose a path in this labyrinth for the reader;
we must leave him the pleasure of losing himself
in it.</p>

<p>Tolstoï belongs to the “school of nature,” if
extreme realism of description entitles him to
that honor. He carries this tendency sometimes
to great excess, even to coarseness. I might
quote many examples of this kind, but they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
would hardly bear translation, and might, occasionally,
be almost revolting to us. He is also
an <em>impressionist</em>, for his phrases often bring to us
every material sensation produced by a sight,
object, or sound.</p>

<p>Finally, his being both pessimist and Nihilist
gives him, as a narrator, almost the impassibility
of a stoic. Persuaded of the vanity of all human
action, he can maintain his own coolness in all his
delineations, his condition resembling that of a
man awaking from sleep at dawn, in the middle
of a ball-room, who looks upon the whirling
dancers around him as lunatics; or the man
who, having eaten to repletion, enters a hall
where people are dining, and upon whom the
mechanical movements of the mouths and forks
make a grotesque impression. In short, a writer
who is a pessimist must assume the superiority of
an inexorable judge over the characters he has
created. Tolstoï employs all these methods,
which he carries as far as any of our novelists
do. Why is it, then, that he produces such a
different impression upon the reader? The
question as to how far he is both realist and
impressionist in comparison with our authors is
the important one. The whole secret is a question
of degree. The truth is that what others
have sought he has found and adopted. He
leaves a large space for trifling details, because
life is made up of them, and life is his study; but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
as he never attacks subjects trifling in themselves,
he after all gives to trifles only the secondary
place which they hold in everything that
demands our attention.</p>

<p>As an <em>impressionist</em> he well knows how to produce
certain rapid and subtle sensations, while he
is never obscene or unhealthy in tone. “War
and Peace” is put into the hands of all young
girls in Russia. “Anna Karenina,” which touches
upon a perilous subject, is considered a manual of
morals.</p>

<p>As to Tolstoï’s impassibility, though his coldness
almost approaches irony, we feel, behind and
within the man, the shadow of the Infinite, and
bow before his right to criticise his fellow-man.
Moreover, unlike our own authors, he is never
preoccupied with himself or the effect he wishes to
produce. He is more logical; he sacrifices style
that he himself may be eclipsed, put aside entirely
in his work. In his earlier years he was more solicitous
in regard to his style; but of late he has
quite renounced this seductive temptation. We
need not expect of him the beautiful, flowing language
of Turgenef. An appropriate and clear form
of expression of his ideas is all we shall have. His
phraseology is diffuse, sometimes fatiguing from
too much repetition; he makes use of a great
many adjectives, of all he needs to add the smallest
touches of color to a portrait; while incidents
rapidly accumulate, from the inexhaustible fund
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
of thought in the farthest recesses of his mind.
From our point of view, this absence of style is
an unpardonable defect; but to me it appears a
necessary consequence of realism which does
away with all conventionality. If style is a conventionality,
might it not warp our judgment of
facts presented to us? We must acknowledge
that this contempt of style, if not to our taste,
contributes to the impression of sincerity that
we receive. Tolstoï, in Pascal’s way, “has
not tried to show to us himself, but our own
selves; we find in ourselves the truths presented,
which before were utterly unknown to us, as in
ourselves; this attracts us strongly to him who
has enlightened us.”</p>

<p>There is still another difference between Tolstoï’s
realism and ours: he applies his, by preference,
to the study of characters difficult to deal
with, those made more inaccessible to the observer
by the refinements of education and the
mask of social conventionalities. This struggle
between the painter and his model is deeply interesting
to me and to many others.</p>

<p>Count Tolstoï would no doubt commiserate us if
he found us occupied in discussing his works; for
the future he wishes to be only a philosopher and
reformer. Let us, then, return to his philosophy.
I have said already that the composition of
“Anna Karenina,” written at long intervals,
occupied many years of the author’s life, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
moral fluctuations of which are reflected in the
character of Constantin Levin, the child and
confidant of his soul. This new incarnation of
Bezushof, in “War and Peace,” is the usual hero
of modern romance in Russia, the favorite type
with Turgenef and with all the young girls. He
is a country gentleman, intelligent, educated,
though not brilliant, a speculative dreamer, fond
of rural life, and interested in all the social questions
and difficulties arising from it. Levin studies
these questions, and takes his part in all the
liberal emotions his country has indulged in for
the last twenty years. Of course, his illusions
and chimeras vanish, one after another, and his
Nihilism triumphs bitterly over their ruins. His
Nihilism is not of so severe a kind as that of
Pierre Bezushof and Prince André. He drops
the most cruel problems and takes up questions
of political economy. A calm and laborious
country life, with family joys and cares, has
strangled the serpent. Years pass, and the tale
goes on toward its close.</p>

<p>But suddenly, through several moral shocks in
his experience, Levin awakes from his religious
indifference, and is tormented by doubts. He
becomes overwhelmed with despair, when the
<dfn>muzhik</dfn> appears who proves his saviour and instructor.
His mind becomes clear through some
of the aphorisms uttered by this wise peasant.
He declares that “every evil comes from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
folly, the wickedness of reason. We have only
to love and believe, and there is no further difficulty.”
Thus ends the long intellectual drama, in
a ray of mystic happiness, a hymn of joy, proclaiming
the bankruptcy and the downfall of
reason.</p>

<p>Reason has but a narrow sphere of its own, is
only useful in a limited horizon, as the rag-picker’s
lantern is merely of use to light up the few
feet of space immediately around him, the heap
of rubbish upon which he depends for subsistence.
What folly it would be for the poor man to turn
those feeble rays toward the starry heavens, seeking
to penetrate the inscrutable mysteries of those
fathomless spaces!</p>


<h4>
<abbr title="Five">V.</abbr>
</h4>

<p>The consolation of the doctrines of Quietism,
the final apotheosis of Tolstoï’s entire literary
work, was yet in reserve for him, revealed
through an humble apostle of these doctrines.
He too was destined to find his Karatayef.</p>

<p>After the appearance of “Anna Karenina,” a
new production from this author was impatiently
anticipated. He undertook a sequel to “War
and Peace,” and published the first three chapters
of the work, which promised to be quite equal to
his preceding novels; but he soon abandoned the
undertaking. Only a few stories for children
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
now appeared, some of which were exquisitely
written. In them, however, you could but feel
that the soul of the author had already soared
above terrestrial aims. At last, the report spread
that the novelist had renounced his art, even
wishing no allusion made to his former works, as
belonging to the vanities of the age, and had
given himself up to the care of his soul and the
contemplation of religious themes. Count Tolstoï
had met with Sutayef, the sectary of Tver.
I will not here dwell upon this original character—a
gentle idealist, one among the many peasants
who preached among the Russian people the
gospel of the Communists. The teachings and
example of this man exerted a strong influence
upon Tolstoï, according to his own statement,
and caused him to decide what his true vocation
was.</p>

<p>We could have no excuse for intruding upon
the domain of conscience, had not the author, now
a theologian, invited us so to do, by publishing
his late works, “My Confession,” “My Religion,”
and “A Commentary on the Gospel.” Although,
in reality, the press-censorship has never authorized
the publication of these books, there are
several hundred autographic copies of them in
circulation, spread among university students,
women, and even among the common people, and
eagerly devoured by them. This shows how the
Russian soul hungers for spiritual food. As Tolstoï
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
has expressed the desire that his work should
be translated into French, we have every right to
criticise it. But I will not abuse the privilege.
The only books which can interest us as an explanation
of his mental state are the first two.</p>

<p>Even “My Confession” is nothing new to me.
In his “Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth” we
have the same revelation in advance, as well as
from the lips of Bezushof and Levin. This is,
however, a new and eloquent variation in the
same theme, the same wail of anguish from the
depths of a human soul. I will give a <span class="lock">quotation:—</span></p>

<p>“I became sceptical quite early in life. For a
time I was absorbed, like every one else, in the
vanities of life. I wrote books, teaching, as others
did, what I knew nothing of myself. Then I
became thirsty for more knowledge. The study
of humanity furnished no response to the constant,
sole question of any importance to me—‘What
is the object of my existence?’ Science
responded by teaching me other things which I
was not anxious to learn. I could but join in the
cry of the preacher, ‘All is vanity!’ I would
gladly have taken my life. Finally I determined
to study the lives of the great majority of men
who have none of our anxieties—those classes
which you might say are superior to abstract
speculations of the mind, but that labor and endure,
and yet live tranquil lives and seem to have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
no doubts as to the end and aim of life. Then I
understood that, to live as they did, we must go
back to our primitive faith. But the corrupt
teachings which the church distributed among
the lowly could not satisfy my reason; then I
made a closer study of those teachings, in order
to distinguish superstition from truth.”</p>

<p>The result of this study is the doctrine brought
forth under the title of “My Religion.” This
religion is precisely the same as that of Sutayef,
but explained with the aid of the theological and
scientific knowledge of a cultivated scholar. It
is, however, none the clearer for that. The
gospel is subjected to the broadest rationalistic
interpretation. In fact, Tolstoï’s interpretation
of Christ’s doctrine of life is the same as the
Sadducees’—that is, of life considered in a collective
sense. He denies that the gospel makes
any allusion to a resurrection of the body, or to
an individual existence of the soul. In this unconscious
Pantheism, an attempt at a conciliation
between Christianity and Buddhism, life is considered
as an indivisible entirety, as one individual
soul of the universe, of which we are but
ephemeral particles. One thing only is of consequence—morality;
which is all contained in the
precepts of the gospel, “Be ye perfect…. Judge
not…. Thou shalt not kill, …” etc. Therefore
there must be no tribunals, no armies, no
prisons, no right of retaliation, either public or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
private, no wars, no trials. The universal law of
the world is the struggle for existence; the law
of Christ is the sacrifice of one’s life for others.
Neither Turkey nor Germany will attack us, if
we are true Christians, if we study their advantage.
Happiness, the supreme end of a life of
morality, is possible only in the union of all men
in believing the doctrine of Jesus Christ—that is,
in Tolstoï’s version of it, not in that of the
church; in the return to a natural mode of life,
to communism, giving up cities and all business,
as incompatible with these doctrines, and because
of the difficulty of their application in such a life.
To support his statements, the writer presents to
us, with rare eloquence and prophetic vividness, a
picture of a life of worldliness from birth to death.
This life is more terrible in his eyes than that of
the Christian martyrs.</p>

<p>The apostle of the new faith spares not the
established church; but, after relating his vain
search for comfort in the so-called true orthodoxy,
violently attacks this church from Sutayef’s
point of view. He declares that she substitutes
rites and formalities for the true spirit of the
gospel; that she issues catechisms filled with
false doctrines; that since the time of Constantine
she has ruined herself by deviating from the
law of God to follow that of the age; that she
has now, in fact, become pagan. Finally, and
this is the key-note and the most delicate point of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
all, no attention should be paid to the commands
and prohibitions of any temporal power as long
as it ignores the truth. Here I will quote an
incident illustrative of this <span class="lock">idea:—</span></p>

<p>“Passing recently through the Borovitzki gate
at Moscow, I saw an aged beggar seated in the
archway, who was a cripple and had his head
bound with a bandage. I drew out my purse to
give him alms. Just then a fine-looking young
grenadier came running down towards us from
the Kremlin. At sight of him, the beggar rose
terrified, and ran limping away until he reached
the foot of the hill into the Alexander garden.
The grenadier pursued him a short distance, calling
after him with abusive epithets, because he had
been forbidden to sit in the archway. I waited
for the soldier, and then asked him if he could
read.—‘Yes,’ he replied: ‘why do you ask?’—‘Have
you read the Gospel?’—‘Yes.’—‘Have
you read the passage in regard to giving bread to
the hungry?’—I quoted the whole passage. He
knew it, and listened attentively, seeming somewhat
confused. Two persons, passing by, stopped
to listen. Evidently, the grenadier was ill at ease,
as he could not reconcile the having done a wrong
act, while strictly fulfilling his duty. He hesitated
for a reply. Suddenly his eyes lighted up
intelligently, and, turning toward me, he said:
‘May I ask you if you have read the military
regulations?’ I acknowledged that I had not.—‘Then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
you have nothing to say,’ replied the
grenadier, nodding his head triumphantly, as he
walked slowly away.”</p>

<p>I have, perhaps, said enough respecting “My
Religion”; but must give a literal translation of
a few lines which show the superb self-confidence
always latent in the heart of every <span class="lock">reformer:—</span></p>

<p>“Everything confirmed the truth of the sense
in which the doctrine of Christ now appeared to
me. But for a long time I could not take in the
strange thought that, after the Christian faith had
been accepted by so many thousands of men for
eighteen centuries, and so many had consecrated
their lives to the study of that faith, it should be
given to me to discover the law of Christ, as an
entirely new thing. But, strange as it was, it was
indeed a fact.”</p>

<p>We can now judge what his “Commentary on
the Gospel” would be. God forbid that I should
disturb the new convert’s tranquillity! Fortunately,
that would be impossible, however. Tolstoï
joyously affirms, and with perfect sincerity, that
his soul has at last found repose, as well as the
true object of his life and the rock of his faith.
He invites us to follow him, but I fear the hardened
sceptics of Western Europe will refuse to
enter into any discussion with him upon the new
religion, which seems, moreover, almost daily to
undergo modifications, according to its founder’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
new flights of thought. It eliminates gradually,
more and more, the doctrine of a Divine Providence
overruling all, and concentrates all duty,
hope, and moral activity upon a single object,
the reform of all social evils through Communism.</p>

<p>This idea exclusively inspires the last treatise
of Tolstoï which I read; it is entitled: “What,
then, must be done?” This title is significant
enough, and has been used many times in Russia
since the famous novel by Tchernishevski was
written. It expresses the anxious longing of all
these men, and there is something touchingly
pathetic in its ingenuousness. What, then, must
be done? First of all, quit the populous cities and
towns, and disband the work-people in the factories;
return to country life and till the ground,
each man providing for his own personal necessities.
The author first draws a picture of wretchedness
in a large capital, as he himself studied it
in Moscow. Here his admirable powers of
description reappear, together with the habit,
peculiar to himself, of looking within his own
soul, to discover and expose the little weaknesses
and base qualities common to all of us; and he
takes the same pleasure in the observation and
denunciation of his own as men generally do in
criticising those of others. He gives us all a side
thrust when he says of <span class="lock">himself:—</span></p>

<p>“I gave three roubles to that poor creature;
and, beside the pleasure of feeling that I had done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
a kind deed, I had the additional one of knowing
that other people saw me do it….”</p>

<p>The second part of the treatise is devoted to
theory. We cannot relieve the poor and unfortunate
for many reasons; First, in cities poverty
must exist, because an overplus of workmen are
attracted to them; secondly, our class gives them
the example of idleness and of superfluous expenditure;
thirdly, we do not live according to the
doctrine of Christ: charity is not what is wanted,
but an equal division of property in brotherly
love. Let him who has two cloaks give to him
who has none. Sutayef carries out this theory.</p>

<p>Those who draw salaries are in a state of slavery,
and an aggravated form of it; and the effect of
the modern system of credit continues this slavery
into their future. The alms we give are only an
obligation we owe to the peasants whom we have
induced to come and work in our cities to supply
us with our luxuries. The author concludes by
giving as the only remedy, a return to rural life,
which will guarantee to every laborer all that is
necessary to support life.</p>

<p>He does not see that this principle involves,
necessarily and logically, a return to an animal
state of existence, a general struggle for shelter
and food, instead of a methodical system of labor;
and that in such a company there must be both
wolves and lambs. He sees but one side of the
question, the side of justice; he loses sight of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
intellectual side, the necessity for mental development,
which involves a division of labor.</p>

<p>All this has no great attraction for us. We can
obtain no original ideas from this apostle’s revelation;
only the first lispings of rationalism in the
religious portion, and in the social the doctrine of
Communism; only the old dream of the millennium,
the old theme, ever renewed since the Middle
Ages, by the Vaudois, the Lollards and Anabaptists.
Happy Russia! to her these beautiful
chimeras are still new! Western Europe is astonished
only, to meet them again in the writings of
such a great author and such an unusually keen
observer of human nature.</p>

<p>But would not the condition of this man’s soul
be the result of the natural evolution of his successive
experiences? First, a pantheist, then nihilist,
pessimist, and mystic. I have heard that Leo
Nikolaievitch has defended himself energetically
against being thought to have assumed the title of
a mystic; he feels its danger, and does not think
it applicable to one who believes that the heavenly
kingdom is transferred to earth. Our language
furnishes us no other word to express his condition;
may he pardon us what seems to us the
truth. I know that he would prefer to have me
praise his doctrines and decry his novels. This I
cannot do. I am so enraptured with the novels
that I can only feel that the doctrines but deprive
me of masterpieces which might have given me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
additional enjoyment in the future. I have been
lavish of praise, but only because of my thorough
and sincere appreciation of the books. Now, however,
that the author has reached a state of perfect
happiness, he needs no more praise, and must be
quite indifferent to criticism.</p>

<p>We must, at least, recognize in Tolstoï one of
those rare reformers whose actions conform to
their precepts. I am assured that he exerts
around him a most salutary influence, and has
actually returned to the life of the primitive
Christians. He daily receives letters from strangers,
revenue officers, dishonest clerks, publicans
of every type, who put into his hands the sums
they have dishonestly acquired; young men asking
his advice as well as fallen women who need
counsel. He is settled in the country, gives
away his wealth, lives and labors with his peasant
neighbors. He draws water, works in the
fields, and sometimes makes his own boots. He
does not wish his novels alluded to. I have seen
a picture of him in a peasant’s costume working
with a shoemaker’s awl in his hand. Should not
this creator of masterpieces feel that the pen is
the only tool he should wield? If the inspiration
of great thoughts is a gift we have received from
Heaven as a consolation for our fellow-beings, it
seems to me an act of impiety to throw away this
talent. The human soul is the author’s field of
action, which he is bound to cultivate and fertilize.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
From Paris, where Tolstoï is so highly appreciated,
comes back to him again the touching, last
request of his dying friend which to me was
inspired by a higher religious sentiment than that
of <span class="lock">Sutayef:—</span></p>

<p>“This gift comes to you from whence come all
our gifts. Return to your literary labors, great
author of our beloved Russia!”</p>

<p>I shall not pretend to draw any definite or
elaborate conclusions from these initiatory explorations
into Russian literature. To make them
complete, we should study the less prominent
writers, who have a right to bear their testimony
as to the actual condition of the nation. If,
moreover, the writer of this book has succeeded
in presenting his own ideas clearly, the reader
should draw his own conclusions from the perusal
of it; if the author has failed, any added defence
of his ideas would be superfluous, and have little
interest or value for the reader.</p>

<p>We have witnessed the at first artificial
growth of this literature, for a long time subjected
to foreign influence; a weak and servile
type of literature, giving us no enlightenment
whatever as to the actual interior condition of
its own country, which it voluntarily ignored.
Again, when turning to its natal soil to seek its
objects of study it has become vigorous. Realism
is the proper and perfect instrument which it has
employed, applied with equal success to material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and spiritual life. Although this realism may
occasionally lack method and taste, and is at the
same time both diffuse and subtile, it is invariably
natural and sincere, ennobled by moral
sentiments, aspirations toward the Divine, and
sympathy for humanity. Not one of these novelists
aims merely at literary fame, but all are
governed by a love of truth as well as of justice,—a
combination of great importance, and well
worth our serious reflection, betraying and explaining
to us, moreover, the philosophical conceptions
of this race.</p>

<p>The Russians seek religious truth because they
find the formulas of their doctrines insufficient for
them, and the negative arguments which satisfy
us would be entirely opposed to all their instincts.
Their religious doubts govern, cause,
and characterize all their social and political
questions and difficulties. The Slav race, under
the guise of its apparent orthodoxy, has not yet
found its true path, but seeks it still in every
grade of society. The formula they are looking
forward to must comprise and answer to their
double ideal of truth and justice. Moreover, the
people still feel the influence of the old Aryan
spirit; the cultivated classes also feel that of
the teachings of the contemporaneous sciences;
hence the resurrection of Buddhism which we
now witness in Russia; for I cannot otherwise
qualify these tendencies. We see in them the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
condition of the ancient Hindus vacillating between
an extremely high morality and Nihilism,
or a metaphysical Pantheism.</p>

<p>The spirit of Buddhism in its great efforts
toward the extension of evangelical charity has
penetrated the Russian character, which naturally
has such intense sympathy for human nature, for
the humblest creatures, for the forsaken and unfortunate.
This spirit decries reason and elevates
the brute, and inspires the deepest compassion in
the heart. Moreover, this simple love of the
neighbor and infinite tenderness for the suffering
gives a peculiarly pathetic quality to their literary
works. The initiators of this movement, after
having written for the benefit of their peers and the
cultivated classes, are strongly drawn toward the
people. Gogol with his bitter irony devoted himself
to the study of suffering humanity. Turgenef
pictured it from his own artistic standpoint rather
than from that of an apostle. Tolstoï, his sceptical
investigations being over, has become the most
determined of the apostles of the unfortunate.</p>

<p>But beyond these mental tortures, beneath the
extreme Nihilism of a Tolstoï and the intellectual
morbidness of a Dostoyevski, we feel that there is
a rich fund of vitality, a fountain of truth and
justice, which will surely triumph in the future.</p>

<h3>
THE SCHOOL OF HOME.
</h3>
</div>

<p>Let the school of home be a good one. Let reading be
such as to quicken the mind for better reading still; for
the school at home is progressive.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>The baby is to be read to. What shall mother and
sister and father and brother read to the baby?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Babyland.</span> Babyland rhymes and jingles; great big
letters and little thoughts and words out of <span class="smcap">Babyland</span>.
Pictures so easy to understand that baby quickly learns
the meaning of light and shade, of distance, of tree, of
cloud. The grass is green; the sky is blue; the flowers—are
they red or yellow? That depends on mother’s
house-plants. Baby sees in the picture what she sees in
the home and out of the window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Babyland</span>, mother’s monthly picture-and-jingle primer
for baby’s diversion, and baby’s mother-help; 50 cents
a year.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>What, when baby begins to read for herself? <span class="smcap">Our
Little Men and Women</span> is made to go on with. <span class="smcap">Babyland</span>
forms the reading habit. Think of a baby with the
reading habit! After a little she picks up the letters
and wants to know what they mean. The jingles are
jingles still; but the tales that lie under the jingles
begin to ask questions.</p>

<p>What do Jack and Jill go up the hill after water for?
Isn’t water down hill? Baby is outgrowing <span class="smcap">Babyland</span>.</p>

<p>No more nonsense. There is fun enough in sense.
The world is full of interesting things; and, if they come
to a growing child not in discouraging tangles but an
easy one at a time, there is fun enough in getting hold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ii">ii</span>
of them. That is the way to grow. <span class="smcap">Our Little Men
and Women</span> helps such growth as that. Beginnings of
things made easy by words and pictures; not too easy.
The reading habit has got to another stage.</p>

<p>A dollar for such a school as that for a year.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>Then comes <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> with stories of child-life, travel
at home and abroad, adventure, history old and new, religion
at home and over the seas, and roundabout tales
on the International Sunday School Lesson.</p>

<p>Pansy the editor; <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> the magazine. There
are thousands and thousands of children and children of
larger growth all over the country who know about Pansy
the writer, and <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> the magazine. There are
thousands and thousands more who will be glad to know.</p>

<p>A dollar a year for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.</p>

<hr class="short">

<p>The reading habit is now pretty well established; not
only the reading habit, but liking for useful reading; and
useful reading leads to learning.</p>

<p>Now comes <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>, vigorous, hearty, not to say
heavy. No, it isn’t heavy, though full as it can be of
practical help along the road to sober manhood and womanhood.
Full as it can be! There is need of play as
well as of work; and <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> has its mixture of
work and rest and play. The work is all toward self-improvement;
so is the rest; and so is the play. $2.40
a year.</p>

<p>You little know what help there is in books for the
average housewife.</p>

<p>Take <cite>Domestic Problems</cite>, for instance, beginning with
this hard question: “How may a woman enjoy the delights
of culture and at the same time fulfil her duties to
family and household?” The second chapter quotes from
somebody else: “It can’t be done. I’ve tried it; but, as
things now are, it can’t be done.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Diaz looks below the surface. Want of preparation
and culture, she says, is at the bottom of a woman’s
failure, just as it is of a man’s.</p>

<p>The proper training of children, for instance, can’t be
done without some comprehension of children themselves,
of what they ought to grow to, their stages, the means of
their guidance, the laws of their health, and manners.
But mothers get no hint of most of these things until they
have to blunder through them. Why not? Isn’t the
training of children woman’s mission? Yes, in print, but
not in practice. What is her mission in practice? Cooking
and sewing!</p>

<p>Woman’s worst failure then is due to the stupid blunder
of putting comparatively trivial things before the most important
of all. The result is bad children and waste of a
generation or two—all for putting cooking and sewing
before the training of children.</p>

<p>Now will any one venture to say that any particular
mother, you for instance, has got to put cooking and sewing
before the training of children?</p>

<p>Any mother who really makes up her mind to put her
children first can find out how to grow tolerable children
at least.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

<p>And that is what Mrs. Diaz means by preparation—a
little knowledge beforehand—the little that leads to more.</p>

<p>It <em>can</em> be done; and <em>you</em> can do it! Will you? It’s a
matter of choice; and you are the chooser.</p>

<p>Dr. Buckley the brilliant and versatile editor of the
<cite>Christian Advocate</cite> says in the preface of his book on
northern Europe “I hope to impart to such as have never
seen those countries as clear a view as can be obtained
from reading” and “My chief reason for traveling in
Russia was to study Nihilism and kindred subjects.”</p>

<p>This affords the best clue to his book to those who
know the writer’s quickness, freshness, independence,
force, and penetration.</p>

<p>The wife of a U. S. lighthouse inspector, Mary Bradford
Crowninshield, writes the story of a tour of inspection
along the coast of Maine with two boys on board—for
other boys of course. A most instructive as well as delightful
excursion.</p>

<p>The boys go up the towers and study the lamps and
lanterns and all the devices by which a light in the night
is made to tell the wary sailor the coast he is on; and so
does the reader. Stories of wrecks and rescues beguile
the waiting times. There are no waiting times in the
story.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant Allen, who knows almost as much as anybody,
has been making a book of twenty-eight separate parts,
and says of it: “These little essays are mostly endeavors
to put some of the latest results of science in simple,
clear and intelligible language.”</p>

<p>Now that is exactly what nine hundred and ninety-nine
in a thousand of us want, if it isn’t dry. And it isn’t dry.
Few of those who have the wonderful knowledge of what
is going on in the learned world have the gift of popular
explanation—the gift of telling of it. Mr. Allen has
that gift; the knowledge, the teaching grace, the popular
faculty.</p>

<p class="muchsmaller">Common Sense Science. By Grant Allen. 318 pages. $1.50. D. Lothrop Company,

<p>By no means a list of new-found facts; but the bearings

<p>We don’t go on talking as if the earth were the centre
of things, as if Galileo never lived. Huxley and Spencer

<p>It takes a learned man to write an easy book on almost

<p>Arthur Gilman, of the College for Women, at Cambridge,
